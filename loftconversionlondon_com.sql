If you have an attic that is still untouched, then you are lucky and should make better use of this part of your home. Loft conversions will help you get the much needed extra functional space that your home needs. You can convert this space to an additional living room, bathroom, bedroom, or even office space. When perfectly done, loft conversions can offer financial rewards if you ever sell your property because they will boost the value of your home. Here are some loft conversion ideas that will help to transform your attic from a cluttered space into a practical, chick room that you will love.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Get Your Loft Conversion Design Right</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Before you start working on your loft, it is important to consider the complete layout of your loft conversion. This means that you should make a decision on where the furniture pieces will be positioned, any built-in storage, and the bathroom if you are constructing one. If you plan to build an en suite, then you should take into account the ceiling height in your attic space. This will ensure that your design is practical before you start construction.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Expose the brickwork</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You can leave one wall of your new space unpainted and expose your brickwork to create a stylish feature that looks great, particularly in an attic that has slanting ceilings. If your brickwork is not in good condition, then you can opt to use wallpapers that will help you achieve the same look. With wallpapers, you do not have to remove the plaster as they can be fitted onto your wall.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Check the Attic Height</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Before you make a decision on what function you want the extra space to serve, you should scrutinize your space carefully. If you discover that you have a double-height room then you can consider creating a mezzanine level of the attic. This will give you a desirable look that has plenty of appeals. With a double-height space, you can create a sleeping area that is above a living room or an extra bedroom with a bathroom on the mezzanine floor.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Manage without a staircase</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you are converting the loft to add extra storage space, you can opt to add a strong and durable ladder for easy access the loft above. This is an excellent way of maximizing your unused space without the need to construct expensive staircases. It can also be an amazing feature for a perfect hideout whenever you need some personal time.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Plan Your Storage</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You should consider creating a customized wardrobe if you are converting your attic space into an extra bedroom. This will help you to get maximum utilisation for your space. With the low-level sloped ceiling, you do not have adequate space to accommodate the standard, ready-made furniture. This is why you need to think outside the box and make use of an awkward space. You can construct handy recesses into the attic to make a great addition to your new contemporary bathroom, particularly when it is designed to complement the existing d&eacute;cor.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Create a Feature Wall to Spark Interest</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Many people opt for white when they want to create an illusion of a lighter and larger space. However, not every homeowner prefers a one-shade scheme. You can opt for patterned wallpaper, especially one that features a subtle repeat print. It should also have a light hue to help add more interest in your space.&nbsp; You can create an illusion of more wall length by positioning your feature wall at the end of the room.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Maximize on Natural Light</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You should think about the position and size of your windows in the loft conversion design. The position of windows will be determined by the shape of the roof, for example, deeper, narrow rooms will look better with one large window, while shallow rooms need windows that are evenly spaced along its length. Every attic space will vary in size and shape, and you should carefully consider the type of window that will perfectly suit your new room.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Highlight Slanted Ceiling</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">When it comes to loft conversions, you should never be put off by tiny spaces and awkwardly shaped ceilings. You can use patterned wallpaper on a small panel or the entire room to create a unique look. Wallpaper is perfect for adding instant personality to your space and you should choose a design that you love. If you are converting your loft into a bedroom, make sure that you go for muted colours for a restful feel.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Showcase your Creativity</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A restricted footprint of most attic spaces should not affect your creative flair. You can add significant value to your loft conversion with a stylish bathroom. With the sloped ceilings, you will have a dramatic frame for your stylish bathtub underneath. For the small spaces in your loft conversion design, go for bold wallpaper design as they will help to give an illusion of a bigger space. Furthermore, a big-patterned feature wall will add personality in a small compact room and will give your new functional space a focal point.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A practical attic conversion can transform the look, feel, and functionality of your home. Keep in mind that loft conversions are not possible for everyone; however, if you have attic space, then it is worth to convert your loft into a functional room. A professional loft conversion will add about 10 to 20% to the value of your property without the need of sacrificing extra garden space that is needed by ground floor extensions. For the best loft conversion, find a company that has the expertise and experience handling attic conversions.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n', '2019-05-03', 'filename_1556874020.jpeg', 1, 'Loft Conversion Ideas to Choose From | Loft Conversion London', '', 'Loft Conversion Ideas to Choose From', 'loft-conversion-ideas-to-choose-from'),
(97, '22', 'Do You Need Planning Permission for Your Loft Conversion?', '<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Do You Need Planning Permission for Your Loft Conversion?</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversions are an easy and convenient way to increase your home&rsquo;s plinth area without putting up a new structure. While this option is quite economical, many people are reluctant to undertake loft conversion projects for fear of being denied planning permission. Contrary to popular belief, it is indeed possible to convert your loft without permission. All you have to do follow a few easy steps.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><em>Professional Consultation</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">In order for you to determine whether you need to apply for planning permission, you will need to procure the services of an architect, builder or civil engineer. Once you tell them what you intend to do with your attic space, they will be able to advice you on whether you need to apply for planning permission or not.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Make sure that their advice is based on your final design as changes to your design may warrant application for planning permission. Alternatively, you can enlist the services of your local building control such as city council to guide you on which conversions are allowable without planning authorization.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><em>Building Approvals</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Whether you need planning permission or not you will still have to ensure that you get building regulations approval. These regulations are in place to certify that any conversion jobs completed are structurally sound. They also vary from project to project depending on the features covered by each regulation.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The key elements include but is not limited to fire safety with regards to materials used, insulation and alarm systems, sound insulation, walls, joists and floors, staircase accessibility in case of a fire and load bearing support.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><em>Additional Roadblocks</em></strong></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Apart from the requirements above, you may also be faced with additional authorization requirements depending on the following factors.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Historical nature</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&nbsp;If you live in a protected historic building, you may face some roadblocks depending on the historic classification grade. Some historic buildings are not eligible for conversions that are bound to alter their original design significantly. So if you live in a historic building, ensure that the changes you wish to make are acceptable by the Heritage Protection Guide. You can find the guidelines on The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings or the Historic England website.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Endangered species habitat</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If for some reason, your attic has been inhabited by any protected species such as bats, various bird species, dormice, wart-biter crickets and V-moths, then you will have to shelf your loft conversion plans. You can get the entire list of protected species on <a href="http://www.phlorum.com/">www.phlorum.com</a>.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">While there are ways to work around it, you will need to hire an ecologist to survey the site and advice on whether you can still convert the loft or not. Even so, your planning permission might still get rejected should they decide to carry out a survey of their own and come to a different conclusion. On the positive side you may still be able to carry on with your conversion if you are successful in getting a mitigation license stating that your project will not endanger the protected species residing in your loft.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Party Wall Agreement</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you live in a detached or semidetached house, you will need to inform you neighbour of your proposed loft conversion especially if the job will affect the shared wall. In this case you will need a Party wall agreement between you and your neighbour stating that the conversion will not affect their property.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You can find templates online that you can then customize to your specifications with regards to you and your neighbours&rsquo; situation. If they are reluctant to sign off, you can have an independent surveyor come in and approve your conversion.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">In conclusion, you will not need planning permission for your proposed loft conversion if your project stays within the guidelines stated below.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><em>General Guidelines</em></strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">The plinth area of the extra space should not exceed 40 cubic meters for terraced houses or 50 cubic meters for detached or semidetached houses.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">There are no verandas or balconies.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Side facing windows are glazed or obscure.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">The conversion does not change the existing roof.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Also do not forget to reinforce the floor below as your current existing floor may not have been built for heavy usage.

It gives homeowners an opportunity to be creative and increase the living space in your house. However, before you rush to start this task, there are several things that you must consider. The planning process can be quite hectic, but it will surely save you time and money over time. To help you get organized and ensure that you have a project that you will be proud of, there are questions that you should ask yourself. Here are the loft conversion questions that you should ask before starting your project.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Why do you want a loft conversion?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">There are several reasons why homeowners choose to extend their living space. One reason is to make improvements in the property that they have invested in for many years. If you are planning to stay in the home permanently, then you need to invest in a quality loft conversion project. In addition, other people opt to convert their loft to add value to their homes and make more profit when they sell the property. You can always speak to a real estate agent to determine how much value the conversion will add to your home.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Some people can also convert their loft to create short-term space. This is usually done when a homeowner needs extra space but does not have the financial ability to move to a bigger home. Knowing why you want a conversion will help you to set up your budget accordingly and avoid overspending in the process. If a conversion is a short-term solution, then it may make sense to save the cash and move instead of spending it in a home that you will leave after a few years.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>How much money do you want to spend in the loft conversion?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Even though this may sound obvious, many people consider a loft conversion before deciding on their budget. This usually results in a project that looks ideal but is way out of the stipulated budget. If you are planning on a loft conversion, then you should think critically and come up with a realistic figure that you wish to spend. Make sure that you communicate this to your building contractor before you get started with your design as you may get recommendations to <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2018/04/five-ways-to-cut-the-cost-of-your-loft-conversion/">save money on your loft conversion</a>. This will help you to save lots of time and will ensure that you do not spend more money than you have planned to.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>What design styles do you like?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">After ascertaining your set budget, you need to think about the style that you want for your loft conversion. You should never assume that your architect and loft conversion building contractors know what you want. There are many loft conversion styles and designs out there and you need to research extensively to come up with the exact design that you want. Ensure that you discuss every detail that you want with the contractors. You can check out our <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/marketing/category/Loft-conversion-ideas">loft conversion ideas</a> to help you make a decision.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Is it necessary to consider building regulations when converting my loft?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">When converting your loft, you must consider the local building regulations. You can get a building completion certificate from your local authority or a nationally approved building inspection company. This will ensure that your loft conversion project is built according to the set building regulation standards. Your property may be devalued if you do not have this certificate and you may have problems selling your house in the future since a building completion certificate is necessary during the selling process.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>&nbsp;When do you want the project to be done?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Many people prefer building work to be done during the spring or summer months. These seasons have good weather and they ensure that construction work takes less time to complete. Irrespective of when you want the building work to start, you must ensure that you start planning for the loft conversion process early. Surveys, designs, <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/marketing/do-you-need-planning-permission-for-your-loft-conversion">applying for planning permissions,</a>, getting building regulations approvals and hiring building contractors take lots of time. It may take several months for your conversion project to get started. This is why you need to be realistic and start the process early enough.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>How long will the loft conversion project take?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">On average, it will take about eight weeks for a loft conversion to be completed. However, the time will vary from one loft to another and depending the building work that is needed. You should also take into consideration the time taken to have the loft conversion plans drawn up and getting planning permission.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Will the loft conversion affect my neighbors?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Before you start your loft conversion planning process, it is important that you consider your neighbors. You will need their cooperation, especially if the construction work will affect a wall that you share. Furthermore, you may need to access their land during the building process. Ensure that you talk to your neighbors to let them know about your project in advance. You need to know whether they have any objections or problems with your upcoming project. This way, you can make minor alterations to your loft conversion plans to prevent your neighbors from raising any material planning objections that will delay your project. Furthermore, you will be able to be on good terms with all your neighbors.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Will my utilities be strained?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">When you add extra living space to your home, you can be sure that your heating requirements, water, and electricity needs will also increase. Your builder should advise you whether a new fuse board is necessary to handle the additional circuits and breakers or whether the shower or bathroom in your loft will affect the water pressure in the rest of the house, necessitating installation of an unvented cylinder or pump.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Do you need work done anywhere else in your home?</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Before you start your loft conversion project, you should check around your home to determine whether you need work done anywhere else in your home. By getting all the work done at the same time, you will save money and time. Furthermore, you will reduce the amount of disruption and time you have contractors in your house.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A loft conversion is a perfect way of adding space to your home. It can come in handy if you have a baby on the way, need a home office, or you have visitors coming to stay. A loft conversion project will add an extra shower room or bedroom upstairs and it will be a less costly project than moving to a bigger property. By asking these loft conversion questions, you will be able to come up with the best plans that will guarantee a successful project.</span></p>\n', '2020-04-16', 'filename_1587043651.jpeg', 1, '9 Important Questions That You Need to Ask Before You Consider a Loft Conversion', '', '', '9-important-questions-that-you-need-to-ask-before-you-consider-a-loft-conversion'),

Leave time for paperwork -</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A planning permission commission almost takes 8-14 weeks to provide a lawful development certificate.

Get a fully cost quote from the builder so that you will be aware of the price of each element, and if anything gets changed, you can refer to the original price per unit.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">5. Eliminate problematic groundwork -</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Avoid building near trees, drains or other services or if you have a detached house, try not to extend too close to your neighbor&#39;s house, it may affect their foundation, and they may apply for a Party Wall Act.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">6. Compare suppliers -</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Compare different supplier price rates form choosing an architect to sourcing a builder.

Get the design accurately -</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">An improvement to the drawings will always require more hours from your architect; on the other hand, any changes during the construction process can cost you more labor, time and materials. Decide the design in one go, as replacements always acquire in extra costs that only become apparent later on. A perfect design ensures that everything is happening in the right place.

It is very common to see lofted houses in London and getting a loft conversion is the best option when converting to two stories doesn&#39;t make any sense. There are a lot of things to consider before opting for a loft conversion. There is also a lot of money involved in getting this conversation started. It costs almost &pound;15,000 for a single room in the roof with a bed and a bath and the price goes up to almost &pound;55,000 if you want a room that is manufactured off-site and then canned into position.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">there are certain things that you should know about before you go for a loft conversion. Some of them are mentioned below.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Is your home suitable for lofting</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Lofting is not possible if your house is completely packed, you will need a specified amount of free space for lofting. You should consider making a pathway to reach a room and there should be enough sunlight and heating in the room. The roof should be in a comfortable position and the room should measure at least 5,500mm side to side, inclusive of a chimney, and 7,500mm front to back. With enough space, you can use the room however you like, you can make it a kids play area, a mini-movie space, or a calm place where you get some alone time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Whom should I use to do my loft conversion?</strong></span></h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Architect/ Technician - </strong>You can always appoint an architect or a technician who will draw up some plans for your room and tell you what is exactly suitable for a loft conversion. You will have to get the necessary approvals for the loft conversion.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Appointing a specialist </strong>- There are companies that offer loft conversion services and when you approach this company they will send their experts to prepare drawings and they will only get the required permissions. The same company will be involved in construction and will turn your dreams into a reality.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Builder </strong>- An experienced builder is as good as every other option so you can prepare the plans by yourself and take help from a builder with the constructions. The builder will be of extreme help when it comes to reducing dust, protecting the roof, and also keeping things safe. You should be extremely sure while taking measurements and if you take the measurements wrong then the whole plan can go sideways.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Permissions -</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversations do not require any specific permissions but if you are planning to make structural changes then taking permission from local authorities is mandatory. Permission is also required if you want to extend the height of the roof or the dome to create extra space. There are also specific regulations that you have to follow. The loft should be safe and there should be risks or structural damage. There should be proper stairs and ventilation too. If you wish to have a party wall you should inform your neighbors and give adjoining notice according to the Party wall agreement 1996.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Plumbing and Insulation -</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The lofted room should have proper insulation and plumbing. There are various other factors that have to be considered but these two make a room resizable. It is impossible to provide insulation to a room if the walls are too thin and add insulation padding and might suck the space of the room and make it too tiny. There should be water and plumbing facilities in the room and most rooms have a washroom so it is necessary to have an efficient drainage system connected to the room.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Selecting the type of loft -</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">There are different styles and models of lofts available like Rooftop conversion, Dormer conversion, Hip-to-Gable conversions, etc but not all of them are suitable for a single home. You have to look at the floor, the roof, the structure, and select a type of loft. The cost of following upon different lofts also varies so you have to make a decision wisely.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversions are common everywhere so you can go around the neighborhood and look out for similar lofted houses and consider the same time of loft conversions they have.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Building and maintaining costs -</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Your financial expenses will not remain the same after you get a lofting conversion. There will be additional expenses to fill up the interior and to equip the room with necessary gadgets. You will have to clean the room regularly and make sure the room is safe from pests and other rodents. All of this increases the expenses and a loft conversion is not cheap. Normal loft conversion costs &pound;15,000 for a single room in the roof with a bed and a bath and the price goes up to almost &pound;55,000 if you want a room that is manufactured off-site and then canned into position. The lofted room which had a bed and a bath could add up to an additional 20% value to the house.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Inform necessary authorities -</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">It is necessary for you to tell your insurance company about the loft conversion. You should show them all the documents and make a change to your insurance policy. The loft conversion can increase your insurance premium. You should also notify them about moving to a different place when the construction work is going on. You can also get renovations insurance and this will help you from any loss of raw material, accidents while renovation, and property owners&#39; liability.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A loft conversion is a huge expense and you should be 100% sure if you want to get a loft conversion. It costs a lot and increases your expenses but it also adds value to your house. You have to take care of so many things like electricity, waterproofing, soundproofing, etc but in the end, it will be worth it. The new room will be the perfect place to enjoy your alone time or spend time with friends and family.</span></p>\n', '2020-10-20', 'filename_1603186945.jpeg', 1, 'Is My Home Suitable For A Loft Conversion', '', 'Is My Home Suitable For A Loft Conversion', 'is-my-home-suitable-for-a-loft-conversion'),

', '<h2>\n	Extend Your London Home with A Basement Conversion.</h2>\n<p>\n	With the liberty to do all desired things with the extra available space, a conversion not only just adds additional value, but gives freedom of creativity. There is no wonder basement conversions are gaining massive popularity with an ability to convert an unused room into a desirable living space. As North London property prices are rising continuously, many property owners in North London with families finding conversion becoming the best option.</p>\n<p>\n	Unlike the loft location at the top of the house, the Basement is located close to the main living areas and has a more flexible range of uses.</p>\n<p>\n	However, while converting your North London basement into a habitable area, there are a number of factors to take into consideration.</p>\n<h3>\n	What is a Basement Conversion?</h3>\n<p>\n	A basement conversion is a process to convert dark, damp and dank spaces into an inhabitable room. The conversion process combined with excavation and expansion includes varying degrees of a basement conversion.</p>\n<h3>\n	Why Should Convert The Basement?</h3>\n<p>\n	There are many reasons for converting the Basement. Extra space is one of the primary reasons. As if you are lacking with space, or have a growing family, you need a space that is close to the other living areas of your home. Growing youngs generally want a separate space where they can spend their own time or can stay with friends. Converted basements are also great for storage, or you can convert it into a home gym.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Gives an additional extra space</li>\n	<li>\n		Add value in the existing property.</li>\n	<li>\n		The basement waterproofing protects against mould and fungal rot infestations.</li>\n	<li>\n		Convenient procedure</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n	Cost Of a Basement Conversion</h2>\n<p>\n	Same type and of property in the same area with damp basements have less value than those with a waterproofed basement. Added extra value is always a plus point when it comes to marketing your property. In most instances, the overall basement conversion cost is less than the additional amount added to the property.</p>\n<p>\n	However, if you have decided to create additional storage or living space in the Basement, selecting a professional specialist would be beneficial.</p>\n<p>\n	Basement conversion costs may include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Waterproofing</li>\n	<li>\n		Flooring</li>\n	<li>\n		Heating and plumbing costs</li>\n	<li>\n		Lighting and electrical costs</li>\n	<li>\n		Decorating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Here we are sharing average pricing details for North London basement conversion:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Conversion of an existing cellar can cost around &pound;750 &ndash; &pound;1,400 per square metre</li>\n	<li>\n		Digging a new basement space and underpinning can cost you &pound;2,000 &ndash; &pound;4,000 per square metre.</li>\n	<li>\n		Digging underneath a garden can cost around &pound;1,500 &ndash; &pound;2,000 per square metre.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Note: All the cost mentioned above is for a rough purpose, kindly coordinate with the specialist for detailed pricing.</p>\n<p>\n	FOR WHAT YOU CAN USE YOUR BASEMENT FOR</p>\n<p>\n	The choice is, of course, yours. Maybe you already have a specific purpose of converting your Basement. However, we can suggest a few common types of a basement conversion.</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Living room</li>\n	<li>\n		Gym space</li>\n	<li>\n		Storage</li>\n	<li>\n		Playroom</li>\n	<li>\n		Bathroom</li>\n	<li>\n		Bedroom</li>\n	<li>\n		Study room</li>\n	<li>\n		Entertainment room</li>\n	<li>\n		Home recording studio</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n	Can I convert the Basement by self?</h3>\n<p>\n	Though there are certainly a few aspects on which you can work, there are other areas which require professionals to cater. Your basement conversion project completely depends on the nature of the project and your skills. A professional explores each area carefully, and you can ask them if there&#39;s anything you can do by yourself.</p>\n<p>\n	TYPES OF BASEMENT CONVERSION</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Dig Out Basement: you will need a dig out if your property is built directly on the foundation. The converting process includes digging underneath your property to extend the property to get further depths through a process called underpinning. After obtaining the required depth and foundation, the work will get formed.</li>\n	<li>\n		New Build Basements: If your property was built from scratch, then surely you will have a built-in basement. Now the conversion process will include excavating the space before the initial construction starts. First, the shell of the Basement gets constructed before the top of the basement shell.</li>\n	<li>\n		Retrofit Basement: If a space under your property is adjusted to shape your Basement, you should go for Retrofit Basement conversion type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	CAN MY BASEMENT FLOOD?</p>\n<p>\n	If you are facing a damp issue in your Basement, it would be not easy to find out the water resource of it. Low-lying areas always stay at risk, and without knowing the cause, it makes it vulnerable to flooding. Common cause of flooding are:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Burst water pipes</li>\n	<li>\n		&nbsp;Surface flooding</li>\n	<li>\n		Groundwater</li>\n	<li>\n		Poor landscaping</li>\n	<li>\n		High water table</li>\n	<li>\n		Drainage system issue</li>\n	<li>\n		Poor quality concrete floors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	WHAT IS BASEMENT WATERPROOFING</p>\n<p>\n	Basement waterproofing includes blocking the passage of water into the Basement, that can be achieved by external waterproofing and cementitious tanking. You can also install a cavity membrane drainage system to manage water intrusion.</p>\n<p>\n	Do the following, before getting started by the conversion:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Clean your Basement, remove all dust &amp; debris</li>\n	<li>\n		Fill the wall holes or repair dent for basement waterproofing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n	Planning Permission and Building Regulations</h2>\n<p>\n	Check with your local authority if any planning permission is required. If you have any conversion specialist with you, then they will take care of the permission procedure on your behalf.</p>\n<h3>\n	Planning Permission for Basements</h3>\n<p>\n	You may not need any planning permission for converting your existing Basement. As, according to the government planning portal, generally people need approval if they are building a new basement. However, it would be beneficial to check before initiating work, if you need any permission for internal or external work.</p>\n<p>\n	Contact your local planning office in writing to get formal approval for initiating your work.</p>\n<h3>\n	Potential problems can occur any time, hence consider to take help from any specialist to overcome issues such as planning permission, plumbing, building regulations, waterproofing and drainage.</h3>\n', '2020-11-02', 'filename_1604320999.jpeg', 1, 'What is a basement conversion?

(73, 9, 'Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors, for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there''s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you?

As a </span><span style="font-size:22px;">client</span><span style="font-size:22px;">, you can rest assured that you will not be disturbed while you live in your home during the conversion process. Throughout the process, we will keep the communication channels open so that you can talk to us, as often and as thoroughly as you like, so that both the parties can understand the progress accordingly. We will give you a dedicated project manager who will be at the site daily to manage the work and ensure the smooth completion of the project.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Here is a brief step by step guide as to what will happen in the loft conversion process:</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">1. We will first visit your place to take the specifications and understand all your requirements for the loft conversion. You will at this stage share your own ideas, opinions and we will discuss various options for your perfect loft conversion. Before our meeting, you can view our gallery of the type of loft conversion you want and if you like </span><span style="font-size:22px;">a design</span><span style="font-size:22px;"> of our past loft conversions. There is no harm to take inspiration or ideas of an existing design.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">2. Once all the specifications have been agreed, we will create a contract that has to be completed by Loft Conversion London and the client. Once this has been completed the next step is to place a deposit so that the first phase of work can commence.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">3. If you have an architect already then you can use them to draw up the plans and if not, we will send our architects to visit your property and survey the areas of work. Our architects will draw up plans for the loft conversion, which can take up to 10-14 working days. Once the drawing is completed, they will be sent to you for review and if you&rsquo;re happy to sign them off then we can submit them to your local council on your behalf if planning is required, and later building regulations. Once the plans are approved by your local council, we will then be ready to commence work.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">4. Party Wall Awards: We can supply the appropriate documentation for you to issue to your adjoining </span><span style="font-size:22px;">neighbours</span><span style="font-size:22px;">.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">5. The full loft conversion building time will be around 8-12 weeks but depending on the type of loft conversion you are going for; this project can be completed much more quickly. The contracts manager will be visiting the site on a weekly basis to check on the progress and ensure everything is being completed at the highest standard.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">6. Our manager will make the last final check on the loft conversion before we arrange the local council or local private contractor to assess your new loft and give a completion certificate. Thereafter your loft will be handed over to you to enjoy your beautiful new loft converted living space.&nbsp;</span></p>\n', '', 'Our Loft Conversion Process |  Loft Conversion London \n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                ', ' Loft Conversions differ in various ways, but they all have the same development stages from start to finish.

An additional floor and head space that isn&rsquo;t just a great solution for your property, but also planning, costing, and regulations of building. Doesn&rsquo;t that sound great? Loft Conversion London; just a perfect fit.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversion is undeniably, an ideal way to increase the usable floors pace and add head height that gives you more options than any other. But, what exactly is Dormer Loft Conversion London?</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200528184641dormer-loft-conversion-barnet.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /></span></p>\n<h1 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">What is a Dormer Loft Conversion?</span></h1>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The Dormer loft conversion is built out of the existing slope of the roof; it is an extension of the existing roof that allows extra additional floor and headroom in lofts having limited space. It is an addition, to the existing roof, it&rsquo;s like a box-shaped structure added onto a pitched roof, creating the walls that are vertical to the slope and 90 degrees to the floor.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<br />\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">It is a kind of conversion that is cost-effective in a way to add extra space to house.&nbsp; The Dormer extension protrudes from roof slope and can be changed to suit variety of styles.&nbsp; This type of loft conversion aids to foster minimal disruption to most of the work, as it is carried out from the scaffolding outside home. There are varied types of dormer loft conversion and which one of it will best suit for your home will entirely depend on the type of property (terraced, detached, semi-detached) and current roof size and shape.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">It is regarded as the most common type of loft conversion for some reasons -</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; Creates additional headspace and floor space&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; Cost-effective.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; No need for permission within specific conditions and limitations.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200611141454dormer-loft-conversion-watford.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 243px;" /></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A Dormer conversion can be added to the side, or front part of the property, it can be considered adding an unsuited, a study, home office, or a bedroom. It depends on the existing structure of your house and the type of dormer conversion you are looking for in your home.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The Dormer loft conversion is a cost-effective way to add extra space to your house. The Dormer extension normally protrudes from the rear of the property, the dormer attic protrudes from the roof slope and this can be changed to suit a variety of styles. We have worked with some dormer loft conversions that have resulted in additional space of up to 50 cubic </span><span style="font-size:22px;">meters</span><span style="font-size:22px;">. This type of loft conversion gives minimal disruption as most of the work is carried out from the scaffolding outside your home. There are several types of dormer loft conversion and the best suited for your home will entirely depend on the type of property (terraced, detached, semi-detached) and your current roof shape.</span></p>\n<h2 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Varieties of Dormer Lofts in London</span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Dormer Lofts are built in a different shape, from the usual flat and shed-shaped to the gabled, pediment, hipped and arched.</span></p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Flat Dormer</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Flat Dormer conversions which are the most common of all conversions as they tend to give the maximum amount of internal space. On the contrary, they might not look as attractive from the outside, but the extra internal space makes it up for the lack of good looks. The gable-fronted and hipped-roof dormers are much more appealing to the eye; however, they may not give much internal space and will surely cost more to build due to the extra bit of complexity.&nbsp; Just for your own knowledge, there are some local councils in London that do not allow dormers so before you select the choice of your loft conversion, ensure you check the rules with your local planning department.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="	https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200804143038gerrards-cross-loft-conversion.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></span></p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Gable Roof Dormers</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The Gable Roof Dormer is the best loft conversion solution for terraced properties. This is also known as the dog-house dormer, which is a more complex conversion which requires the gable wall extension upwards to meet the current </span><span style="font-size:22px;">ridgeline</span><span style="font-size:22px;">, with a new sloping roof area also built towards the new gable end.&nbsp; This conversion does not require planning permission. We simply work on the existing pitched roof in order to </span><span style="font-size:22px;">maximize</span><span style="font-size:22px;"> space. By adding vertical windows, you increase the sunlight and space.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200803144649loft-conversion-brentford.JPG" style="width: 500px; height: 667px;" /></span></p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Hip Roof Dormer</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The hip roof dormer is quite like the gable roof dormer in terms of the general structure; however, the actual roof layout is different. A hipped roof dormer is a conversion where the roofs slope on all three sides of the structure. &nbsp;This conversion is attractive to look at but this type of conversion results in less internal usable space. Areas around </span><span style="font-size:22px;">the UK</span><span style="font-size:22px;"> that are prone to high winds </span><span style="font-size:22px;">favor</span><span style="font-size:22px;"> this type of loft conversion. Overall it is </span><span style="font-size:22px;">a complex</span><span style="font-size:22px;"> conversion to construct due to the sloping planes.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200611141844velux-loft-conversion-watford.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /></span></p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Shed Roof Dormer</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The Shed Roof Dormer is a similar conversion to that of the flat roof, the only difference being the angle at which the roof slopes down. The shed roof dormer has only a single sloping plane. These are </span><span style="font-size:22px;">the best</span><span style="font-size:22px;"> suited for properties of the Victorian era or homes with a gable roof.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200528184632hip-to-gable-loft-conversion-barnet.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 331px;" /></span></p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Arched Dormer</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Last on the Dormer Loft Conversion variety is the Arched Roof Dormer. This is loft conversion that has an arched roof and best suited for period properties of the Victorian era.</span></p>\n<h2 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>WHAT TYPE OF LOFT CONVERSION IS MOST SUITABLE TO YOU?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The right kind of loft conversion London is influenced by 3 major factors &ndash;</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">The type of roof you actually have right now</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">The main purpose you want to use the loft for</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Your budget, yes!</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>IS YOUR HOME SUITABLE FOR LOFT CONVERSION LONDON?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The most important factor to consider when starting to think about converting the loft space within your home is your existing loft structure. You can consider a dormer if you have a pitched roof and loft space.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>DO DORMER LOFT CONVERSIONS LONDON REQUIRE PLANNING PERMISSION?</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Planning permission is generally not required, but when you cross the limitations set by the authorities, you may have to do some paperwork. A loft conversion is usually considered under permitted development, and is subject to some limitations and conditions -</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; Allowance of 40 cubic meters additional roof space for terraced houses*</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; Allowance of 50 cubic meters additional roof space for detached and semi-detached houses*</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; No extension beyond the plane of the existing roof slope of the principal elevation that fronts the highway</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; No extension to be higher than the highest part of the roof</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; Materials to be similar in appearance to the existing house</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; No verandas, balconies or raised platforms</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; Side-facing windows to be obscure-glazed; any opening to be 1.7m above the floor</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; Roof extensions not to be permitted development in designated areas**</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; Roof extensions, apart from hip to gable ones, to be set back, as far as practicable, at least 20cm from the original eaves</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679; The roof enlargement cannot overhang the outer face of the wall of the original house.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversion London usually works under limitations, however, the permission is still required.

A traditional roof is about 2.2-2.4 meters high while a modern trussed roof has a minimum height of 2.4-2.6 meters. For a habitable space the preferred headroom level is 2.3 meters. This height need not be maintained over the entire floor area, and a lower height may be acceptable for a bathroom, hallway or kitchen. If your head height is lower than the above, this can be achieved by lowering underneath the floor ceilings.</span></p>\n<h2 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>WHAT ARE THE SERVICES THAT DORMER LOFT CONVERSION LONDON BESTOWS?</strong></span></h2>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Building up something that brings out a good return on investment and brings value to your space.

A traditional roof is 2.2 to 2.4 meters high and the minimum requirement for a modern roof is 2.4 to 2.6 </span><span style="font-size:22px;">meters</span><span style="font-size:22px;">. The ideal level of headroom for any habitable space is around 2.3meters. This height is not necessarily maintained in the whole area, but a lower height may be fine for the bathroom or corridor. If your loft&rsquo;s height is lower, then 2.2meters then loft conversion will be possible by lowering the ceilings of the floor underneath.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">How to get natural light into a Dormer Conversion?</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">In a Dormer loft conversion, you can get natural light coming in from the dormer windows (vertical) and the skylights too.

My baby is due next month, and I want to fix him a nursery that is airy and full of sunlight. </strong></em>We build a Velux Loft for this client which did not require planning permission.

Commuting to the city everyday with the distance and travel are too taxing for me as I just pass the golden line.

The end result was a light and airy loft that was private and quiet, exactly what the doctor ordered.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Aarav A&nbsp; - <em><strong>We have our loft converted years ago and my wife used it according to her fancy.

A <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/velux-loft-conversion">roof light loft conversions</a> is the most cost effective as the only change is made on the loft by adding windows so very little structural work is required.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_67131.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">2. <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/dormer-loft-conversion">Dormer loft conversions</a> are the most popular option as lights are easily added and increasing the amount of roof space will offer a full headroom.

The <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/hip-to-gable-loft-conversions">hip-to-gable conversion</a> are made on semi-detached homes or found on the side of end-terrace.

Being a professional Loft Conversion Company, we travel all over London to hear what our clients want to achieve and how we could help them achieve their conversion goals.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">So people planning to create more space in their Edgware home to be used as additional living area, extra bedroom for a growing family, a private or office space, can opt for loft conversion as the perfect solution.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/loft-conversion-edgware-orange-hill.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Why Choose Loft Conversion for that extra space?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">When we undertook our very first loft conversion in Edgware, we came across many cynics who claimed that building an extension was the best way to create additional space; but we always cited six benefits of loft conversion that are unrefutable so here they are:</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">1. Adds value to your house</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Studies made by property experts showed that loft conversions are one of the prime ways to increase in your home investments. In fact, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/27/home-extension-or-loft-conversion-can-add-20-to-house-value">Housing Market Research discovered that the value of your house increased by as much as 20%.</a></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">2. No need to pay for the expensive cost of moving.</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Say goodbye to the cost moving. no more expensive stamp duty, solicitor fees and property costs that continue to rise. It appears that the cost of moving to a new house gets higher every year.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">3. Increases space of your property</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">With the well-planned space loft conversion, you will have an additional storage space below your stairs while it eliminates the strain of needing more storage to the rooms in your home as well.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">4. Enhance lovely view from room</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The window of your loft conversion will offer you a great a surprise when you gaze out and see the magnificent view of the sea or the Downs at a distance/ at a distance. You are able to survey your local area from an entirely new perspective.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">5. Increase your source for natural light</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversion windows as <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/velux-loft-conversion">Velux</a> and <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/dormer-loft-conversion">Dormers</a>, let in much lighter than the other windows in your home. Houses and trees on the street outside no longer blocked the light going to your place.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">6. Time and money saver with a loft conversion</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">No other home improvement provides the most savings for time and money than from loft conversion, the reason why is that much of the structure you need is already in place.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/loft-conversion-edgware-orange-hill2.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Brief History of Edgware&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Edgware&rsquo;s enjoys the best of location being far enough outside of central London but you still enjoy the aura of urbanism with fantastic transport links to the city. For this reason, many London families settle in Edgware. However, as those families are growing and need more space, they might be forced out of the area but thanks to <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/">Loft Conversion London</a>, they do not have to endure the prohibitive cost of moving to a new house. This is the reason why Edgware loves Loft Conversion London for assisting them to create extra space allowing their family to grow without the hassle of moving.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">At the onset, <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/about-us">our company</a> will assign a dedicated project manager to supervise your loft conversion in Edgware. He keeps it on schedule and within your budget.

This will be determined by a number of different criteria, from available space, to property size and your available budget.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<em><strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Four main options are:</span></strong></em></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>1. <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/dormer-loft-conversion">Loft Conversion: Dormer</a></strong> -This type of loft conversion uses a vertical wall placed at the sloping roof&rsquo;s bottom. To provide more space in the loft&rsquo;s extension, a flat roof is made to meet the vertical wall. The Flat Dormer is one of the most popular types of loft conversions and also one of the most cost effective. It also provides large amounts of internal space in comparison with most other style. Planning permission is often not needed.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_56665.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 600px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>2. <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/hip-to-gable-loft-conversions">Loft Conversion: from hip to gable</a></strong> &ndash; Purpose of this type is to expand a relatively tiny space through a hipped roof so that it changes the flat gable making the sloping or &lsquo;hipped&rsquo; side of a roof. Planning permission may be needed. Extra space can be used as office or any other purpose. This type is suitable for detached, semi-detached, chalet and bungalow properties.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_79531.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>3. <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/mansard-loft-conversion">Loft Conversion: Mansard</a></strong> is usually constructed at the back part of your property, its flat roof and a back-wall slope inwards at 72 degrees. This type is more expensive loft since it involves significant change to the structure of the property as well as more construction work. These are particularly common in urban areas and in terraced housing. Windows are typically housed in dormers. Planning permission is often required.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_82593.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">4. <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/velux-loft-conversion">Loft conversion: Velux</a>&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 22px;">Depending on the scale and amount of construction required, loft conversions can be done between 6-8 weeks. However, Velux loft conversions are the easiest to build and the project done within 4 weeks.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_67131.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Velux is a window manufacturer and the most commonly used windows in <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/velux-loft-conversion">Velux loft conversions</a>. Another way to refer to this build is a type of roof light loft conversion. This design is comparatively easy to install, with only one of the existing rafters needed to be trimmed out per window. The existing roof structure remains intact and the windows then slot in at an angle to the roof, rather than vertically. Not only is the build time shorter on this style, but due to the minimal alterations, the costs are considerably lower. A <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/velux-loft-conversion">Velux loft conversion</a> works better where there is plenty of headroom available, or if gaining planning permission may prove problematic.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/loft-conversion-edgware-orange-hill3.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>From Planning and Designing Your Loft Conversion to Building It</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Our company will follow all your specifications in mind, which will be laid out during the design stage.

Contact us for any enquiries.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h1>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>What Things to Consider before undertaking a Loft Conversion?</strong></span></h1>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Of all parts of your house, the loft stands as one of the easiest and least troublesome space to convert into a more meaningful and useful room. Moving to a bigger place is stressful and expensive that will disrupt your normal life, as well as, you&rsquo;re your family. According to a report filed by the <a href="https://www.rics.org/uk/">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</a> (RICS), it was revealed that loft conversion is just <em><strong>one third the cost of moving to a bigger property</strong></em>. It is also profitable as loft conversion increases the value of your current home by as much as 25%.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/loft-conversion-harrow1.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Head height - Do you have adequate height for a loft in Harrow?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A potential room in the loft needs a height clearance so that the measurement from the highest point of the roof to the floor should be a minimum of 2.3 meters. To make the space habitable make sure that the loft space in your Harrow house must have the height as stated by the local building regulations.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Strengthening the roof and floor</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Consider the structure of the loft conversion. In some instances, you need to provide more strengthening for your loft by using steel beams to underpin the floor and roof itself. This will be required if the structure of your house is deemed weak by the structural engineer. It is for your safety and the durability of the house that roofs and floors are strengthened.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Loft staircase</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The Law stipulated that any loft conversion must have its own permanent separate staircase. However, stairs must be provided for a loft conversion to fit the measurement of the area allocated but it does not need to follow the width of the steps on lower flights in the home. Make sure the landing of the loft has enough space for head clearance.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Use natural light</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft needs lots of natural light. One option is to install roof/velux windows or skylights so there will be more lights and extra ventilation to the room. Use skylight access for a fully open roof window to provide not only natural light but also a point of access to a roof terrace or other outdoor roof space. This is a cost effective thing to do and it reduces your electricity bill in the long run.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">About planning permission</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Not all loft conversions require a planning permission as the rules were relaxed way back October 2008. But to be sure. check before carrying out any serious work. However, if your dormer or Velux windows are in the front of the property then you will need planning permission. Anything that alters the roof will require planning permission.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Raise the property value</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Believe us when we say that loft extensions increase the value of a property. Not just 5 or 10% but the increase goes up to 20% after loft conversions. So, you might want to think about that because the rates of the property are never decreasing but they are always increasing with every passing year.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Some frequently asked questions about Loft Conversions in Harrow?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">As usual, we always share with you the questions and answers included in our Loft report.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">1.

We have also advised them on the importance of having an extra space in one&rsquo;s home, particularly if you have a growing family. Space is always an important issue when a population is on the rise. Initially, I told home owners that our company was in town to solve their problem of space. Most homes have lofts that are idle only gathering dust and creepy crawlies. That place will be an ideal space to convert into a living area that can be enjoyed by their families.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Many believe on this practical advice, so today, loft conversion is everywhere in Hatch End.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Here are the main types of loft conversions to choose from:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">1. Velux (Roof Light)</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/velux-loft-conversion">Velux</a> does not change original shape of your loft so you will only need small alterations for the roof to fit and help keep the cost to a minimum while helping you discover your dream space. One advantage of <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/velux-loft-conversion">Velux </a>is its versatility. More information about velux will be explained by our specialists.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">2. Dormers</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/dormer-loft-conversion">Dormer </a>reshapes the roof to give greater internal height and space; there are many different styles but in most cases. the rear of the roof or the let side is the location of loft conversion. Although Velux windows provide extra natural light, but in general, the dormer conversions are popular all over the UK. This is because they offer excellent head room height, and good amount of space in general. Large dormers offer the most benefits and more value for money.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">3. Hip to Gable</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">With the hip of your existing roof extended into a Gable end, greater roof space is given that allows a larger rear dormer to be constructed while maximizing your interior space. <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/hip-to-gable-loft-conversions">Hip to gables</a> look more physically attractive than dormer conversions. A rear dormer loft conversion and a hip to gable loft conversion can be combined with the best results. This type of loft conversion is most popular in traditional homes.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">4. Mansard</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This type of loft conversion is similar to a flat roof dormer, with a front slope of about 70 degrees as the main difference. Windows look more aesthetically pleasing in a <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/mansard-loft-conversion">Mansard Conversion </a>when it appears like small dormers. The benefits provided by the Mansard conversion is all that extra space. Almost as if the property as extra room when you raise one side of the pitched, the attic space transformed immediately into a roomy living area.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Of the different type, the <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/dormer-loft-conversion">Dormer loft conversions</a> are the most popular style of loft conversion as they provide additional head room and floor space.

Determine the amount of light and head room you want.</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">So, you want a loft conversion bedroom with big skylight? The cost of conversion will increase if you raise the height of your roof, or add skylights and more windows, as well as other structural changes. So, if the standing room in your attic is adequate for a habitable space, you could still save by limiting your new room to its present dimensions.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Consider carefully what you will be the use of the space for: will you be adding a complete bathroom, or you will want a higher ceiling than what is available.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Talking about money, sometimes spending more to make more space is worthwhile in the long run. Although more windows are more expensive, but you get more light that is bright and welcoming than having less windows. Many who have their loft converted regretted about not choosing the right layout where they will have more windows, dormers and roof lights plus others.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">For more options, our loft conversions guide will help you find out more about the different conversions available.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>2. Make sure to finalize your plans and send them off for early planning approval</strong>. In some areas, loft conversion planning permission is not required.

If it is position over the pipework of the floor below, a great amount of the plumbing cost will be reduced. For there is no need to reroute the plumbing across the building, so it will therefore be cheaper.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">5. Get everything in writing</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Once you have your builder or chosen a loft conversion company, as well as an architect, make sure you have your quote and, most importantly, what is included, in writing, so you won&rsquo;t get a nasty surprise.

The best of these buildings&rsquo; edifice is found at the Elm Park Court at the intersection of West End Lane and Elm Park Road that could only be described as <em>megnifico</em>.

There are really two options available if you&rsquo;re looking to expand living space without moving from home. Will you choose loft conversion or house extension? We have participated in long and interesting debates about this issue and here are some arguements for each.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">1. Loft conversion</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">We choose <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/">loft conversions</a>, for home owners are given ample opportunity to extend upwards instead of outwards. No need to worry about lack of space as there is always the option of increasing the headroom by raising the roof.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/">Loft conversions</a> does not make the room appear dark for they offer a surprising amount of light with the introduction of skylights or dormer windows, giving more natural light and providing a beautiful view.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Unlike extensions, majority of conversions do not require planning permit. But you can inquire from our staff the conditions loft conversions must meet. You will, however, have to follow all Building Regulations standards.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversion can be a way to save from heating bills, as loft conversions follows insulating your home using the current building codes and practices &ndash; leaving you cozy and warm but not cramped.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">With loft conversion, you can have a new spare bedroom while opportunities are&nbsp; endless &ndash; how about a fancy office at home? or a larger bathroom, an entertainment area or a place for the kids to hang out?</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Check your home if there is any place to convert? There may be more space than you think. In fact, you might even have a potential living space of about 30%.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversions have been shown to offer the biggest increase to property valuations over other forms of extensions and improvements, and based on Nationwide estimate, your gain is up to 20%.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">We all acknowledged that building works in your own home can be disruptive, messy, and noisy affairs. Loft conversions, on the average is quicker to complete than extensions so you have more time to enjoy your new space, and less time watching the work of your builders.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_81196.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">2. Home extensions</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">It wonderful to have a sunroom to sit in and appreciate the garden, a downstairs bathroom or a kitchen large enough for cooking with friends. An extension is just the right answer, particularly if you require a ground floor living space.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/">Loft conversions</a> also require a permanent staircase as their access point, adding the problem of adequate space in hallways and landing below. An extension bypass this issue by allowing access points through doorways and structural openings.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You might have no problem about permits as a good architect or engineer will often help to guide you through the process without too much hassle &ndash; and many builders can also give you a few helpful tips.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Two-storey extensions are often cheaper for less work is involved in creating a second level than the ground floor, and together they can offer virtually unlimited potential. Why not add a bedroom on top? Your budget might be inadequate with unlimited potential of building more.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A space on ground floor level is needed for an elderly resident, young child or someone with a physical disability making a single-storey extension the way to go. With the extension, your access is allowed from point of convenience you agreed upon.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">In your extension process, you can utilize only materials that are eco-friendly by using plasterboard insulated to the walls or conventional cavity walls replacement constructed with foam rigid type of insulation and a tiny gap of air.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Benefits of Loft Conversion in Pinner</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">1. You create the extra space needed.</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You realized that an extra space at home is needed and have started considering buying a new house for its solution. However, you overlook the existence of your vacant loft and you can see its potential use.

You can use any extra space as home office office, game room or for any other purpose. This type is ideal for detached, semi-detached, chalet and bungalow properties.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_36859.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">3. <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/mansard-loft-conversion">Mansard loft conversion</a> &ndash; Usually constructed at the rear, Mansard is usually constructed at the back part of your property, its flat roof and a back-wall slope inwards at 72 degrees. This is the more expensive loft type since it involves major changes to the structure of the property and requires well as more construction work. These are like the terraced housings particularly common in city areas. Windows used the dormer type.

I always admire its Landmarks found in the suburb including the gigantic Art Deco Hoover Building, the magnificent Church of St Mary (circa:.12th century), the River Brent that travels SW to join its mother Thames and Perivale Wood Local Nature Reserve, one of the oldest nature reserves in Britain, run by the Selborne Society.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Brief History about Perivale, Ealing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">I agree that Perivale is a family perfect place with its safe roads, large &amp; lovely homes and fast commuter line. Families in Perivale, Ealing live in comfort without any space problems as most homes have loft conversions.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">During my initial visit to this place, people were new to idea of loft conversions so most of my time was spent in explaining the value of transforming their homes to bigger place and at the same time, add value to their property. My company, being the top loft converter in London, was able to deliver excellent work at the most affordable price offering them quality materials and constant controlling and monitoring of the building process.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Why convert your Loft in Perivale?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This is always the first question I had to answer. Why not? Then I ask them when was the last time they really used their loft? I found out that people love the idea of converting their loft to add home space. When I mention the loft, they all imagined an empty space at home filled with cast-away clothes, dusty toys, old books, cobwebs and more. The loft is a great place for the kids to play, and the perfect location to hide the old junk. But when the children grow up, what is then the use of the loft? Or do you want your loft to be a permanent storage of all your junk that you eventually have to donate so some charities or throw away. On the other hand, an extra space like a loft conversion will always be useful in every household.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">It would be a wonderful idea of transforming your loft into a home office? or a spare bedroom for guest? Considering the cost, it is so much cheaper than having a building extension. Aside from utilizing unused space, you also enhance the value of your property.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A loft conversion is a very economic decision. According to most mortgage lenders, at least half of homeowners cannot afford the cost of moving when their residences become too small for the family, so they decide to stay put. They realized that converting existing space offers an affordable way to gain that extra space.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/velux-loft-conversion-london.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Kinds of Loft Conversion in Perivale</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">1. <a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/dormer-loft-conversion">Dormer loft conversion</a> has many styles and is categorized as, double, full, L-shaped, rear, and single dormer loft conversions.

Market research stated that the value of your home is increased by 20% after adding space like this to your property.

Conversions with a view</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you live in a bungalow, your view is blocked by other homes on your street, so you do not have a panoramic view of the outside. Being higher, a conversion gives you an entirely new perspective on your surroundings.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">5.

Cost of room in roof loft conversion</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The price of a room in the roof loft conversion starts about &pound;15,000 which is the cheapest and most straight forward option. This will cover the cost of reinforcing the floor, installing several skylights plus installation of a staircase to the loft electrics, lighting and heating observing fire safety measures to comply with the Building Regulations of fire doors and smoke alarms.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Other factors might affect cost to convert your loft such as your roof structure, the existing available space or whether you need some chances to accommodate the staircase</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">2. Dormer loft extension</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This is space added above with the addition of dormer windows. This increases the useful floorspace and that can be used to add head height which gives you more options where to place the stairs. This type of dormer loft extension cost upwards to around &pound;20,000. However, the average cost for a dormer loft conversion is about &pound;35,000&ndash;&pound;45,000.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">3. Raising the roof or changing the roof structure</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This alternative is the most expensive as it requires the complicated removal and rebuilding of the existing roof. You have to hire a designer for this type conversion requires planning permission approval and you will need to factor in the design cost, as well as. the cost of the planning application. The cost of this type will likely be around &pound;40,000. It still cost less than ready-made room options that is up to around &pound;55,000 for the average home. These are fabricated off-site and then craned into position</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">4.Can any loft be converted?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Yes. nearly all lofts or attics are convertible if they are not breaching any guidelines in planning or conservation.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">What matters most will be the height of your roof ridge. If you were to stand in the center point of the roof and measure from the top of the existing ceiling joists in the inside of your loft, to the top of the ridge board at the apex of the roof, and you have a minimum of 2.2 meters, then the loft is suitable for conversion. If the measurement is less than 2.2 meters, even though the regulation on height has been relaxed in loft conversions, it is unlikely you would have enough useable headroom clearance.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/loft-conversion-london-bathroom.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" /></span></p>\n<h1>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>5 factors to consider before a Loft Conversion in Perivale</strong></span></h1>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Planning permission</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Aside from a couple of exceptions, planning permit is not normally needed in loft conversion. This is required if you live in a conservation area, or if you intend to extend the roof space. To be sure, check with your local planning department, or contact a home improvement company who can do the work for you.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Height of the loft space</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The head height should be at least 2.2.m to ensure the right height. Although some professionals prefer to work with a minimum of 2.5m; it depends on the company. It should be taken between the underneath the ridge board (in the apex), and the top of the ceiling. Or request a loft conversion installer to help, and save you from any hassle.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Window style</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The main choice of windows for your new loft conversion will be between roof and dormer windows. The best classic style comes from Velux. The latter has vertically beyond sloping roofs, while the roof windows are placed directly into the pitched roof. Both styles of window will flood your loft conversion with light, and make the room feel bright and airy. Dormer windows provide further usable space and are therefore may be more likely to need planning permission. The room will be flooded with lots of lights from both styles of window since this loft conversion makes the room feels airy and bright.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Use of the space</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Before you enquire with a home improvement company, you will want to think about what the room will be used for, whether it be for an extra bedroom, a play room, or another usage. Knowing this when you are asking for quotes from local tradesmen will ensure that they can design a loft conversion specifically for your needs &ndash; and tailor it towards how you intend to use the room.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Work of loft conversion is only for the experts</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversion cannot be a DIY project since it is very complicated and only for experts.

Dormer</strong> -This type of loft conversion uses a vertical wall placed at the sloping roof&rsquo;s bottom. To provide more space in the loft&rsquo;s extension, a flat roof is made to meet the vertical wall.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_56665.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This is the most common type of loft conversion that can also be gable fronted or hipped roofed.

Mansard</strong> is usually constructed at the back part of your property, its flat roof and a back-wall slope inwards at 72 degrees. This type is more expensive loft since it involves significant change to the structure of the property as well as more construction work. These are particularly common in urban areas and in terraced housing. Windows are typically housed in dormers.

Question &ndash; What are the different types of loft conversions?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Answer - The different types of loft conversions will depend on the type of home you live in and the type of roof that is already on the house. The two most common loft types are the dormer conversions and hip to gable conversions.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">2. Question - What is the ideal height of a converted loft?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Answer &ndash; The ideal height should be at least two meters high at the peak if you are planning on converting it.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">3. Question - What is the best access to a converted loft? &nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Answer - You have many good options: use a pull-down ladder, a spiral stairs, or even regular staircases if you have the access space.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">4.

It&#39;s possible to add walls and doorways in such a way that you can finish and convert only a portion of your loft, leaving the rest for simple storage. This is often a great idea for very large homes, since converting the entire loft would be a very large project.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">7. Question - &nbsp;Is it difficult to add a staircase as an entry?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Answer - This depends on your home&#39;s layout.

Your contractor should be able to create a new entry point from anywhere in your home, such as at the back of a hallway or even the corner of the kitchen or living room, if this is more convenient for you.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Everyone loves a little more space and enough room to move around?

They are using conversion to add light, drama and value to many homes. Your converted loft can be the main feature of your home as the lightest and airiest room for conversion moves upward to breathe the atmosphere of the London skyline. For decades, loft conversions used to be expander armory for many homes in London before the rage of kitchen extensions.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Do you know that the loft conversion was the very first home improvement that one saw, going back 30 years?</strong>&nbsp; Probably thousands and thousands of designs have been made that they are in their second or third generation. There has been no problem encountered so it lasted the test of time and now ready to face the challenge of the new generation.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/home-office-hillingdon.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Shared tips on what you should know about Loft Conversions</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">One of the versatile methods to add value and space into your home is loft conversion. However, this is not as simple as it sounds but complicated and expensive as well. There are important things to know before starting a stress-free conversion process.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversion types</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Simple conversion type is the cheapest as it will use the existing space in the loft without any build-out from your roof. On the other side, the more costly will include the Mansard conversion that goes around the entire length of your home. Below is an image of a Mansard Loft Conversion.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_82593.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" /></span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">About planning permits</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">No planning permit is required in most loft conversions for homes built in the UK are already inclusive of built-in allowances for permitted developments. However, the extension from the exterior of the original building is the determining factor. In the extreme, you will need planning permission when your loft is extended over the permitted development.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">More building regulations</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You will still need to match up to the building regulations even if no planning permit is required. The layout determines if you require regulations when you need to install a new fire door on the loft as well as in other rooms. Permission is a lengthy process so it is wise to know what regulations may affect your property.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Height of ceiling</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A minimum of 2.2m at the location of the tallest-part is the needed distance that goes all the way from the ceiling to floor. If the distance of the planned loft conversion is not adequate, you need to make changes to your roof or even lower your floor. But all these changes are extremely expensive.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Sharing walls</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you live in a terraced home, you will need to obtain a &ldquo;party wall agreement&rdquo; because loft conversion may affect the walls you are sharing with your neighbors. You need this because the walls you are sharing with your neighbors is affected.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This agreement gives you their consent to conduct any work on the wall that is adjoining their home.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Step-by-step ideas in loft conversion </strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The following step below will help you to decide and convert your loft into any space as dinette, guest room, home office, reading room and whatever. Before conversion, be sure to know what you need. Most small spaces will appear larger with the right kind of d&eacute;cor and become live able and also eco-friendly place.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Check for compatibility</strong>:</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The first step is to check the compatibility if your loft is convertible or not. You need a minimum of 2.2m head heights to convert the loft for this height is suitable and perfect for normal height. If the height is below, you need to push up your loft roof and it will be so costly. If there are any obstacle to be removed as water tank or stairway, then the cost will increase. Before work is started, remember all these to consider.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Use the small space</strong>:</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Some homes have bigger loft space while some have smaller.

By adding a couple of windows, air can pass properly and add a fan. Mirrors will provide lighter and make the room appear bigger. Use white or off-white to add bright colors and feel free to make your room brighter. To create a healthy room environment, have more open windows, fans, mirrors, and utilize only brighter colors.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Prepare the design:</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Start preparing proper plan for the loft design first and work according to the scheme.

Check if your loft is suitable for conversion.</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A minimum head height of 2.3m &nbsp;(7 feet 6 inches) is needed for the loft to be fitted for conversion although it can have other obstacles: like chimneys, water tanks, as well as, &nbsp;the pitch of the roof, and this can also affect the work. To gain the required headspace, remove some parts of the roof, however, cost will be more, and you have to apply for planning permit, unlike a more simple conversion. Another option is to lower the ceiling of the rooms below but this again is quite expensive. A modular conversion will have the room build in the factory and installed by parts later.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">2. Choose the right loft conversion design for your Ealing house</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You study the layout of your completed loft conversion design before you start the work. Decide the position of your pieces of furniture, the bathroom inlay and any built-in storage. If you are planning a grand type of room, consider the height of the ceiling in the space and prioritized pieces&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">3. Utilise fully the daylight in your loft conversion.</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Make use of the natural light entering you loft conversion. Consider the position of the windows and take time to measure them. Then position your windows as part of your conversion design. To maximize natural light, the general rule is that glazing in the roof area must only be 20 %.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">4. Use loft conversion to balance out your Ealing home</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Whatever space you lack at home will be taken over by a loft conversion for this is the best option to balance your home. Utilize loft conversions as an extra bedroom or a suite with a modern bathroom. You can also create a kid&rsquo;s den, an entertainment room with cinema or a home private office. Make use of the amazing views seen from your new loft windows by moving some of the living spaces into the new loft, so the family can enjoy the view.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">5. Turn your loft into a stylish bathroom</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">To create a modern bathroom in a gawky measurement and stocky beams will not be a problem with a suitable design.

Add a practical and stylish shower room</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A loft is the right place to have a stylish shower or wet room but you must have ample space for the shower&rsquo;s headroom. Aside from this, you need to fit an extractor fan if the windows are small. To make the most of the space, a glass panel can be a good addition.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">7. Create a home office in your Ealing loft</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you do not need any extra bedroom in the loft and plan to work from home, a home office might be the best option. To maximize productivity, a home office requires plenty of natural light, so get rid of those black-out dark blinds and drapes of heavy materials. Instead, choose pale colored blinds in cool neutral shades that allow the entry of light and eliminate the glare but allows you enough light to work efficiently.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">8. Give kids their own room</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Kids find it cool to have the loft converted as their own private bedrooms, playrooms or extra space to keep them cozy and busy to enjoy their time. Use &nbsp;&nbsp;simple scheme and soft furnishings with other accessories. This way, you can easily change the room&rsquo;s theme.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">9. A dressing room in your loft conversion</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Make good use of the space in the eaves by creating a dressing room that could be used to build in storage with an awkward sloping roof. A perfect place with the large skylight flooding the space with natural light and floorboards positioned to give the appearance of a longer space.

A walk &ndash;in wardrobe</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you don&#39;t have adequate space, you can incorporate a walk-in closet in your new space. An open wardrobe or clothes rack must offer you all the amount of space required. You will have some shelves to show your collection of bags, shoes, hats and whatever.</span></p>\n<h1 style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/mansard-loft-conversion-london.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></h1>\n<h1>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft Conversion Ideas to Maximise Space and Light</span></h1>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversions are the new chic way of renovating your house.

Every visitor sees the three landmarks of the borough : (i) Paddington Station that was a master design of the famous engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel FRS, who was &quot;one of the England&rsquo;s most prolific figures in 19<sup>th</sup> century engineering history&quot;; (ii) St Mary&#39;s Hospital where Prince William, Prince Harry, Prince George and Princess Charlotte were all born; and (iii) Paddington Green Police Station that is the most important high-security police station in the United Kingdom. The place is vibrating with life with many new developments like the ongoing Paddington Waterside project that is bringing back the vitality of the former railway and canal land.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Living in Paddington</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The place is a perfect blending of bright and sunny offices with the grandiose elegant Georgian townhouses. Paddington station is a busy area being home to the Heathrow Express. Travelers stay on the pleasurable hotels near Norfolk Square Gardens and enjoy sipping their coffee or tea at the casual cafes lining Pread Street. Explore outside Paddington&rsquo;s grand station and find lovely canals, quiet serene garden squares, plenty of places to eat and stay, and have a taste of its famous friendly beer.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The London terminus for Heathrow Express train to London Heathrow Airport is the Paddington station that is a 24-hour service to the airport leaving every 15 minutes. London Paddington station never sleeps for it is open for the whole days as well as night.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Loft Conversions for the Beautiful Paddington Homes</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">In Paddington&rsquo;s beautiful homes, families live happily without complaining about space problems because they all enjoyed the benefits loft conversions. They are aware that the goal of our company was to offer quality loft conversions in Paddington, and we stayed with them from its concept through completion, and fully satisfied the wide spectrum of client needs and tastes.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">From the onset, people in Paddington enjoyed the combined experience provided by our company for decades ensuring that our loft conversion staff are experts in their respective fields. They gave Paddington the best deal in loft conversion that was carried out to the highest standards. We designed their unused space and build rooms for various uses as study, office, hideaway retreat or bedroom.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/loft-conversion-london-bathroom3.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Types of loft conversions for Paddington</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">1. W2 Dormer Conversions</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This type of dormer extends your existing roof by adding floor space and headroom within the loft conversion. Since dormers behind your property normally protrude from the roof slope, it has types of styles. In lofts with limited space or headroom, a dormer adds adequate space makes conversion the best solution.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_56665.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">2. W2 Mansard Conversions</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">There are two slopes in a Mansard roof: the lower slope and the top section of the roof. It maximizes the available space within your loft by raising the party/gable walls on either side of your house and creating the timber frame. are not often seen in the suburbs. Unlike the other types, a planning permission is required for a Mansard loft conversion. This type of roof gives you the maximum amount of space in your loft conversion, but it has one disadvantage; construction cost will be expensive since you must replace the entire roof.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_82593.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">3. W2 Velux Conversions</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The existing roof structures are not changed as Velux windows are installed to fit flush with the line of the roof. As no extensive changes are made on the roof, it helps to keep the cost of the conversion down. No planning permit is required as the loft is not extended beyond the original roof. Bad weather is no reason for any delay in fitting a Velux roof lights that can be done quickly and easily.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_54065.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Loft Conversions: frequently asked questions</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If your plan is to add a loft conversion to your home, whether you can surely add value or to create more space to make your home more comfortable, then you&rsquo;ve probably got some questions. These can range from the obvious to the intricate, and I always include them in my reports.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size: 22px;">Is loft conversion affordable and how much will it cost?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This is one of the most common questions people have when they think about getting a loft conversion, and it&rsquo;s a logical one. However, it&rsquo;s difficult to be exact on the amount until the company providing you with the services knows what kind of conversion you want. A simple conversion costs less than a full bathroom or wet room conversion because of the more detailed nature of the design.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/frontend/main/feature_16099.jpg" style="width: 284px; height: 210px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size: 22px;">Is planning permission needed for a loft conversion?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The hassle that comes with planning permission means that a lot of people are put off at the mention of it. But since October 2011, if you aren&rsquo;t extending your roof space, planning permission rules have been changed, meaning you don&rsquo;t need it for a loft conversion as it falls within the category of permitted development.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/frontend/main/feature_74689.png" style="width: 300px; height: 190px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size: 22px;">Is a water tank a problem?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A water tank in the loft does not mean that you can&rsquo;t have a loft conversion. We can help to move your water tank so that you get a usable space, though many people prefer to update their water tank for a combi boiler and remove the problem altogether.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Is the size of my loft too small for a conversion?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You might be surprised to find what can be achieved with a dormer window and with its imaginative design. Of course, you need a minimum of 7&rsquo;6&rdquo; height in the tallest portion of the room. Some houses could not provide adequate floor space, but most conversion rooms could even accommodate a queen-sized bed.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/frontend/main/feature_36859.jpg" style="width: 276px; height: 210px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">How long does a conversion take?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A very another common question but the answer depends on what it is you want to achieve. A simple loft conversion can be done in about 4-6 weeks, but a larger or more complex conversion could take up to 8 weeks to complete.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/frontend/main/feature_22917.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 182px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Is dormer conversion the best option?</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A dormer window adds a smaller loft space, giving you more headroom and better positioning of the staircase. Through a dormer window offers better angled views and better lighting options compared to a single skylight.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Solutions for roof problems</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If the roof space reveals a head height that is less than 2.2m, you can opt for two available but more costly solutions that also needs a professional input.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/frontend/main/feature_64935.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Solution 1: Raise the roof</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This means more expensive but possible for your kind of structure, but another requirement is to secure a planning permit approval. If you have to remove the entire roof, you need a scaffold structure to protect the house from unfavorable weather during the works.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Solution 2: Lowering the ceiling in the room below adds extra height</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This will require existing ceiling to be lowered that will result to more work and much mess. This method adds bolted plate to the wall to be used as anchors shields or to hang from the new floor joists. An appropriate tie placed between the middle part of the roof structure and the formed dwarf wall to keep the roof spreading.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Here are good words from our clients about their loft conversion</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">I requested some of our former clients to give me their words about loft conversion that I am including a few in this report.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">*Isabelle S. - Thanks to loft conversion for we are now enjoying extra living space. My whole family benefits from the extra space for even a minimal space from your loft conversion will make you feel that your house is a lot bigger.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">*Mr. D - The project ran smoothly as I was not required to secure a planning</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">permission!&nbsp; A loft room is the quickly and easily done without any hassle. Wish I could have more lofts converted.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&nbsp;*W.B.A. &ndash; A great relief for me as the extension adds extra space without sacrificing my garden. I have spent years growing my outdoor garden. Thankfully a roof space conversion extends upwards instead of outwards, so it does not touch what precious space you have outdoors.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">* Mr. &amp; Mrs. P &ndash; Loft conversion was done at home in the least disruptive ways &ndash; no mess, big holes or dirt in your garden! Since almost all work is done entirely inside the loft room, the rest of your home will remain almost untouched.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">* Abdul - One of the biggest and best reasons why I consider a loft conversion is that it can increase the value of my home. What surprises me was the value will go up by as much as 25%. So, converting your loft is a great idea in terms of return-on-investment.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">* Dr. S &ndash; Do you know that creating a functional living space within your converted roof room even without adding installation can save you on those heating bills as it has trapped the extra warmth inside your home? Loft conversion is a good way of lowering your monthly bills!</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">* Edna &ndash; My family is growing and thanks to loft conversion we do not need to move to a new house. Converting your space means you won&rsquo;t have to move out of your current area, so your kids won&rsquo;t have to leave their school or friends. And it removes the stress of moving.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">*JJJ - Multi-generational living is becoming the norm for many families as life expectancy is ever growing and creating the need for more obligatory space! Through loft conversions, you can have multiple generations like grandparents, grandchildren and other family members live happily and comfortably together under one roof.</span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Why choose Loft Conversion London?</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Our company is known for being a leading Loft Conversion company because of our track record.

It lies west of Kingston &amp; Hampton Wick and its two sides are adjacent to Bushy Park. With water stripes in the riverside, Public Heated Open-Air Pool in Hampton served as the people&rsquo;s swimming pools in Greater London. The residential islands above Molesey Lock boost of grand or decorative buildings such as the Astoria Houseboat Recording Studio, the Garrick&#39;s House; the Temple to Shakespeare; the Astoria Houseboat recording studio; and more. You can go to the main park of Molesey and Thames Path National Trail.by crossing the Thames via the Hampton Ferry.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Living in Hampton</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The north of the district of Hampton has terraced homes and the south district are filled with semi-detached homes. Many residents at the western edge of London commute to adjacent boroughs or to Central London as many are employees in various schools &amp; educational agencies, hospitals &amp; health centers, social services, retail businesses, transport and food services because transport is easy.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Hamptons homes feature styles from several periods like period cottage to Georgian houses with Victorian terrace. Before the 20<sup>th</sup> century, there are several home types, such as the contemporary, detached, flats, and semi-detached. If you pass by Taggs Island of Thames and near to Hampton, you will be amazed to see various types of houseboats. The dilapidates &amp; ramshackle boats are owned by the commoners and the glamorous &amp; stately owned by royalties.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The Hamptons is a unique area where no two houses are exactly the same for price per square foot varies in value. Many factors considered are those involving cost of land, proximity to school, distance to the train station, age of the building, period of the property and the plot size.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Some of preferred residences in Hampton</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Take a stroll with me around Hampton and choose where you want to live:</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">1.

If music&rsquo;s more your thing, a loft can provide the perfect space to play without distractions for you and others; just ensure there&rsquo;s plenty of soundproofing.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/frontend/main/feature_96489.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Types of Loft Conversion in Hampton</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">I always recommend these four common styles available and once we view your property, we can advise you on the best design to suit your home. This will be determined by several different criteria, from available space, to property size and your available budget.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Four styles are:</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>1.Dormer loft conversion</strong> &ndash; A vertical wall placed at the sloping roof&rsquo;s bottom is used in this type of loft conversion. A flat roof is made to meet the vertical wall to provide more space in the loft&rsquo;s extension. As one of the most popular type, Flat Dormer is also one of the most cost effective. A large amount of internal space is provided in comparison with most of the other style. There is no planning permission needed.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_75845.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>2. Hip to gable loft conversion</strong> &ndash; This type expands a relatively small space into the hipped roof so that changes are made. The flat gable makes the sloping or &lsquo;hipped&rsquo; side of a roof. It is best to inquire about planning permission. You can use any extra space as home office, game room or for any other purpose. This type is ideal for detached, semi-detached, chalet and bungalow properties.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_79531.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>3. Mansard loft conversion</strong> &ndash; Usually constructed at the rear, Mansard is usually constructed at the back part of your property, its flat roof and a back-wall slope inward at 72 degrees. This is the more expensive loft type since it involves major changes to the structure of the property and requires well as more construction work. These are like the terraced housings particularly common in city areas. Windows used the dormer type. Inquire about planning permission.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_82593.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">4. Velox loft conversion -</span></strong><span style="font-size: 22px;">Velux loft conversion can be finished within 6 to 8 weeks if the amount of the required construction is simple and not complicated. However, Velux loft conversions seems to be the easiest to build and the project can be completed within 4 weeks.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_54065.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Why loft conversion all the way</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">1. For more extra space</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">No need to worry about the lack of space in your home, so do not waste time and money by starting to plan to buy a new house for this problem. However, you have failed to notice that there is a space in your loft that can be used wisely. Yes, you can convert this extra space to use in terms of your need.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">2. Property value increased</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Ask any property expert how loft conversion increases your investments. The increase in your property value is not only 5% or 10% but that your property value will go up by 20% after loft conversions. An these days, property rates never decreased but always escalate year by year.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">3. Have that extra storage area</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft extension to have more space to store needed items from the different house corner. When unimportant items have space in your loft, then it will be easy for you to walk around secluded area in your house without any furniture or box blocking your way.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">&nbsp;4. Increased investment plus more space</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversion is like hitting two birds with one stone. If you dream of a master suite or add a guest bedroom or even an entertainment area, a loft conversion is the easiest option to do it and you are gaining more as you are adding value to your property too.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">5. No planning permit required</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">An additional space added to your home, like loft conversions are generally allowed under right permitted developments so there is no need to go through the hassle of a lengthy process getting planning permission.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Because of these benefits of loft conversion, homeowners are easily convinced that this option is the best, compared with buying a bigger place or house extension.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size: 22px;">Some useful links for you to read on before starting your Loft Conversion.</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/marketing/loft-conversion-ideas-to-choose-from"><span style="font-size: 22px;">Loft Conversion Ideas to Choose From</span></a></p>\n<p>\n	<a href="https://loftconversionlondon.com/marketing/do-you-need-planning-permission-for-your-loft-conversion"><span style="font-size: 22px;">Do you need planning permission for your Loft Conversion</span></a></p>\n<p>\n	<a href="https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/loft-conversions/article/loft-conversions/loft-conversions-step-by-step-guide"><span style="font-size: 22px;">Step by Step Guide to Loft Conversion</span></a></p>\n', '', 'Loft Conversion Hampton | Hampton Loft Conversions Company                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ', 'Looking for a Loft Conversion Company in Hampton?

Research studies conducted by the Nationwide Building Society in their research concluded that up to 20% to your house value is added by loft conversion. If you&#39;re looking at a house valued at &pound;200,000, that&#39;s an increase of up to &pound;40,000. We have been converting lofts for more than 3 decades and we can attest to this benefit.</span></p>\n<h1>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Six main types of loft conversion</strong></span></h1>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">1. Loft conversions called the roof light is the cheapest type as it needs the smallest amount of work in the structure of the existing space. The only alteration made is the addition of windows.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/velux-loft-conversion-bedroom.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">2. The most popular type is the loft conversions called dormer that offers double advantages: easy way to add more lights and achieve a full headroom by increasing the roof space. To have a bigger flat-roofed &lsquo;box&rsquo; dormer, change the roof structure at the sides or back of the house.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_56665.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">3. Usually found on the side of either end-terrace or semi-detached houses is the loft conversion called hip-to-gable. Removing the hipped (or sloping) side of the roof, a new vertical gable is formed when the end wall is built up straight.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_36859.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">4. A new box extension is included in this gable-to-gable loft conversion that spans the space in-between each gable end. To act like bookends, you need to lengthen the height of the gable end walls.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">5. If you need extra volume, Mansard loft conversion is your type. The process is quite complication as the sides are very steep and sloping while over the top flat roof is placed.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_82593.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">6. When the existing loft space is not adopted for conversion, use the modular extension loft conversions. The new room measurements are taken and a modular loft is manufactured off site and delivered to the house as a module. For installation, the existing roof must be removed,</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>There are versatile ways to utilize your converted loft:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Create your own stylish loft bathroom.</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Bulky beams with awkward dimensions have very limiting factor but they be used to create a bathroom in an available loft space. The shower might require an amount of headroom and an easy entry, a bath can be constructed under a low ceiling. Utilized plain and simple shapes, as well as, the usual color palette for it complements period architecture. You can depend on your reliable loft roof to become a usable space with a stairway as access. Imagine the extra bedroom with a modern bathroom, or study or workroom you always wanted in the loft that could turn out to be the best and most spacious room in the house, a place you will be proud of.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/loft-conversion-london-bathroom3.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Your very own home office</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If do not need an extra sleeping quarter in the loft and a new sleeping area is not your family needs, but decide to work from home, then a home office might be the best use for your converted loft. To maximize productivity and produce more work, your home office must have lots of natural light. Refrain from using those black-out blinds and heavy dark solid drapes. Instead, opt for pale blinds as pink, light blue and neutral shades that allow entry of natural light in but at the same time minimize the glare. Light is necessary during the summer months, as well as, during the winter months when cold days are shorter.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/home-office-hillingdon.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Loft conversion for kids</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Your kids will laud you for giving them the loft as their very own space with no mommy watching their activities. They can even decorate the room themselves, but it must be cozy with lots of light and air. Children&rsquo;s room must be filled with light and bright colors. Kids must be encouraged to express their personality using colors, decors soft furnishings and other accessories.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Your loft conversion dressing room</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Now you have your own dressing room after you made use of the space in the eaves with built in storage that helps to overcome the limitations of an awkward sloping roof. The large skylight floods the space with natural light, while the proper position of your floorboards will give you the appearance of a longer space. How about tacking a wardrobe onto the side of a large master bedroom?</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Your walk &ndash; in closet</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Movie stars are proud of their walk-in closet that they proudly show off in the magazines. Why not create one for you? This would be a good idea to use your loft conversion. Since your space is inadequate but plan to create a walk-in closet into your loft conversion, opt an open-type wardrobe or a clothes rack to maximize the space you want.

Height of the head</strong> &ndash; It must be about a minimum of 2.2 m so measure from the top of the ceiling joist until the bottom of the ridge timber.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>2. Pitch angle</strong> - The more useable floor area of your loft conversion can have 40&deg; or more to be considered suitable for a conversion.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>3. Any obstacle?</strong> Before any loft conversion plans, consider fixed obstacles found in the area such as chimneys, ventilation pipes and water tanks that need to be considered.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>4. Structure age</strong> &ndash; Houses built before 1960 have more conversion friendly structure than houses built post 1960s.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>5. Shape of loft&rsquo;s end</strong> - Affecting the complexity and floor space calculations are shapes of the ends of the loft like Gable (straight) or Hipped (angled) .</span></p>\n<h1>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Types of loft conversions for Twickenham</strong></span></h1>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">1. Dormer Loft Conversions</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A dormer simply extends the existing roof, making loft conversion space in the additional floor space and headroom. An additional space will be provided for loft&rsquo;s limited space or headroom that would make possible conversion.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Although flat roof dormers are unattractive outside, they provide a maximum amount of additional internal space. On the other hand, a conversion of the gable fronted and hipped roof dormers conversion will look much more attractive but they are more complicated and will be more expensive.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_56665.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">2. Mansard Loft Conversions</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">There are 2 slopes in a Mansard roof, the lower slope is vertical at 72 degrees and the top section of the roof is horizontal. An advantage offered by a Mansard roof is maximizing the available space within your loft. Mansards are not often seen in the suburbs and almost certainly require planning permission.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">While this type of roof will give you the maximum amount of space in your loft conversion, it does have a disadvantage as it involves replacing the entire roof the construction that will increase the cost.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_82593.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">3. Velux Loft Conversions &nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This type of conversion is generally very cost effective as it is is quick, simple and in most cases, &nbsp;it does not require planning permission. Windows of roof light Velux are easily installed and only require at least one of the existing rafters to be trimmed out per window.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Where there is a good amount of headroom or if there are constraints on planning, a Velux type loft conversion works very well for lofts. For example, if you live in a conservation area and there is an extremely limited headroom, then a better option is either a dormer or mansard conversion. There will be disruption or delays while making the conversion even during bad weather since Velux roof lights can be fitter fast and easily.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/velux-loft-conversion-london.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Tips to bring down the cost of Loft Conversion in Twickenham</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">1.

Compared to other types, the dormer has vertical walls and horizontal ceilings. They could be shaped as flat, hipped, or L-shaped.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_56665.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">2.

Hip to Gable loft conversion is most suitable for detached or semi-detached homes. The three slanting sides to the roof is then extended to the outside wall where the gable end is built up. The front slop builds up the conversion following completion of rear dormer and Velux windows so there is an extension on both sloping sides.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/images/temp/full/gallery_soft_36859.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">4.

This implies choosing where you will situate household items, the restroom, and most importantly the furniture.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">In the event that you are planning an en suite, consider the roof tallness in the space and organize pieces of furniture like cupboard and sofa that are proportionate to the room size.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>3.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>HIRE THE BEST STATE OF THE ART DESIGNERS -</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">With regards to the loft conversion plan, there are two basic principle choices -</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is to commission a planner, for example, a designer or an architect, to create drawings, which can be put out to manufacturers on a serious delicate premise. You will have the option to control the creator to make precisely what you need, however expenses for what is a generally little venture might be high as the extent of hiring an additional architect. Loft Conversion Chiswick gives you the full facility from start to end in one place. your budget is not moved or bothered by any new additional expense like designer and architect.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other alternative is to hand the entire task over to a structure-and-manufacture temporary worker, who will have a planner, designer, and developers in their group like Loft conversion London.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>4.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Install provisions that gives maximum sunlight -</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Giving your maximum effort to consider the size and position of your windows is a significant part of a loft conversion plan. When in doubt, the coating should make up 20 percent of the rooftop zone in case you&#39;re quick to expand regular light. The situation of the windows will frequently be directed by the state of the rooftop; for instance, a long, shallow room will profit by windows divided equitably along its length, while a limited, further room will profit by one enormous window.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Finalize the designs that give maximum thought into expanding sunshine to get tons of bright natural light into your loft conversion. Install color contrast blinds for loft conversion windows to guarantee you can make it perfectly dim when you need to, as well.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>5.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Add an additional bathroom -</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If your floor plan has enough bedrooms that suffice your needs but you lack in the bed and bath ratio then you should consider designing your home accordingly. The best design would be to install an extra small bedroom with a proportionate bathroom floor plan. If you want to create a huge room with an attached bathroom then you must have your designer take a look at your basement. Most basements serve as a small loft in themselves.

There are plenty of great plans that can turn your<strong> flat loft conversion</strong> into a most lovely place. An attic extension can help to add that extra space, which you were always looking for. While renovating your Loft space, a couple of significant elements you need to take care. Before beginning the work, obtain all designs into one place, as a <strong>Flat Loft conversion</strong> idea includes a lot, such as storage, bedroom, study room, bathroom and many other plans, and that needs to be done in the best way possible.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Embrace the space proportions - Avail the advantage of that naturally cosy feeling of the flat loft conversion for the smaller or bigger. You can&#39;t beat the white colour if you are opting for a light coloured scheme. Natural white colour can give you a feeling of a larger and lighter room. Though try to balance the white colour with warm woods and the occasional soft furnishing with dark pattern, to give it a lively and welcoming appearance.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Tiny Reading corner - If you have not left with any spare room, you can still get a small reading corner, assembled with a study table and bookshelf. Transforming the loft area is not just about to create extra space; it&#39;s about adding some value in the existing space. You can develop your reading corner according to the personal style and age. As if it is for a kid, it should have toys, sketching books, comics and should paint in bright, energetic colours.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximize daylight in your flat loft conversion plan - Consider the window size and position while planning for a loft conversion design. For natural sunlight, 20 percent roof area should be glazed. Commonly windows get designed according to the shape of the roof, since a room varies in shape and size, consider the size of the window accordingly. However, it must allow an unspoiled view and more headroom and will be on the best height to reach effortlessly.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convert the loft area into a beautiful Lounge - Why not use that low ceiling space which is not fit for a bedroom or bathroom? You would love to lounge in the attic, with this budget-friendly <strong>flat loft conversion</strong> idea. Incorporate it with bean bags, lovely rugs, indulged with your favorite paintings to add extra decor and with scattered toys to make it an ideal place to hang out with kids.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combine a stylish bathroom - Why not utilize that extra space as a master bathroom? Create a room for a freestanding bath under a low ceiling, as shower needs a minimum headroom space. Combine it with just necessary limited things and a traditional colour pattern can add a periodic architecture. Just using one sheet of unframed glass, supported by two sleek stainless-steel bars will help to keep this wet room enclosure minimalist and unobtrusive.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build new storage -&nbsp; Maximizes the available space by embracing the awkward spaces by inserting shelves on the problematic corners. Even you can have cupboards custom-built into a slanted roof. Without capturing a large area, these ideas can give you a convenient storage solution.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add a tranquil guest room - If you have young children, it&#39;s not always possible to have a master bedroom in your attic. Don&#39;t hesitate to turn it into a fancy guest space where older people can reclaim their peace and stay away from the early riser noise.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn the wall of the angle into a feature - A tiny little space and clumsily shaped ceilings can put you away. Don&#39;t let it be, paint your small panel with unique colours, as a background leaves a significant impact on overall feeling, so choose a more mute and deeper shade for a comfortable feel, or you can paint using bright and bold colour.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a small library - Create a dedicated spot to fulfil all your reading cravings with a collection of your favourites. You can even make a library in 10sq m space to put to good use. Pick an area where you can easily tuck your cosy chair where the ceiling isn&#39;t so high that it can be under a roof or a stairwell. Features with a glass wall and door can give a sense of privacy.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explore all the angles - Why not take complete advantage of the roof line during your flat loft conversion which can be practical and visually impressive? Use an existing attic space smartly and combine with some glazing panels including a wooden framework, a series of partial-height walls which will allow plenty of sunlight and space.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get the right loft stair extension - Consider all the available options to maximize the space during your flat loft conversion. Ideally, it should be continuous stairs from ground floor to the first floor, and should also be considered during the early stages of a loft conversion. However, match the designs with bannisters, paint finishes, and handrails. Apply the same carpentering as flooring, skirting and modelling to blend it perfectly with the rest of the house, and give it a feel of neutral addition.</span></p>\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#39;t forget about the exteriors - If your flat loft conversion includes exterior extension, even its complementing your existing property, choose matching brickwork or rendering or cladding to give it a perfect contemporary finish. Frameless and minimalist-style windows can add a fabulous appearance in modern homes. However, there can be a conservation requirement for a periodic property if you are looking for a loft expansion.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you are browsing for loft conversion ideas, a question - &#39;can any loft space get converted&#39;, can easily arise in your mind. Of course, it needs proper planning and a professional approach to turn it into real value.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">However, if you are struggling to give your loft area the desired extension within your budget and space, contact us to get the desired conversion with a peaceful mind.

Loft conversion barnet helps you in the transforming of your loft area into a guest room in a significant way, and adds value to your home without having to build an addition to your home. We love to create a simple design of this small loft room or according to your preferences, with the proper combination with the light colour scheme to brighten it up so that it feels roomier than it measures out to be! It gives a perfect desirable look with plenty of appeal.</span></span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Escape to a calm living room -</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;">We help you to create the perfect escape in your home while having some extra living space in the loft. Where you will like to spend time socializing with family members or friends. Loft conversion barnet experts can help you to keep things casual with a perfect classic look, balancing with a sofa and mismatched armchair with beautiful neutral colours. It can perfectly combine with some couple of super-cool accessories, such as pouffe and rugs to give a personal touch.</span></span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Open out the balcony </strong>- <span style="color:#ff0000;">The open out balcony idea is especially useful in a roof space where it might be challenging to fit Velux (ventilation light) windows or a dormer in the slope of the roof. It may look like an ordinary attic window when it&#39;s closed, but it offers instant outdoor space and the upper-floor spaces with angled ceilings can feel stuffy and constricting. Experts from the Loft conversion Barnet suggests dormer windows to reform into outdoor areas where the top half can get converted into the vertically opening area within an overhang along with the bottom half featuring pop-up bannisters.&nbsp;A person can also opt for a triple window with bottom glasses that swing out to the side. With a standard balcony railing, a full-sized door will lead to a small terrace.&nbsp;In the open out balcony, the top-hung window section rotates at 180 degrees which allows easy cleaning and work as a shield for the indoor space during rain and thunderstorms. This balcony can smoothly get open and gives your loft space proper sunlight and air, along with a great view of the home.</span></span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Convert a narrow loft into children&#39;s bedrooms -</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;">Adapt a loft area into an en-suite wet room, supersized skylights and a space-extending dormer for little ones, but it&#39;s essential to keep them cosy so they&#39;ll get plenty of use. Do not fill a child room with lots of stuff. A child really likes a spacious room where they can spend their time comfortably and play freely, without getting hurt. Must-have things which should be in a child room are; a comfy chair, storage to keep their toys and books, a small study table and a cute swing chair can make together a perfect combination. We prefer to keep the scheme simple and inoculate personality through the use of delicate furnishings accomplished with other accessories. This way, changes can be made quickly and inexpensively as their interests change very frequently. For kids, an attic ceiling is perfect for patterned wallpapers, designers at Loft conversion barnet narrow down a selection of appropriate motifs. We prefer to take the preferences of children for their favourite. It helps to give an extra add on with featured beds covered with fairy tale designs or with their favourite character posters. And certainly a Sweet dreams.</span></span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Low loft storage -</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;">While it comes to loft storage concepts, it is desired to get every inch most out of the limited space. Although compared to ready-made, a customized storage option might be costly. Also, lighting is very critical, while deciding the storage options, as lofts are usually highly exposed to skylights rather than other places in the house. Loft conversion barnet prefers to use the bottom section of the loft&#39;s wall. Low-level units are beneficial when they get extended along with the girth or the length of the attic. The best way to fully utilize the loft is dwelling on the eaves, by creating an enclosed space to store things such as old toys, books, suitcases, and even Christmas decorations. We can help to maximize the loft area by creating a wall-to-wall type of storage, creating cupboards that follow the slanting slope, as we understand that every slanting inch of the loft is essential. This practice ensures to utilize the maximum of all the available spaces.</span></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">An ideal loft head height should be 2.3m which is usually perceived as adapted to convert, although chimneys, a pitch of the roof or water tanks can be an obstacle, and can influence the decision. Although if the roof space is less than 2.3 meter, we can make it possible to achieve it, by removing a few sections of the roof, or all of it.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Though complex projects may require the expertise of an architect while working with Loft Conversion Barnet, you just need to relax and watch your dream transformation.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Why Choose us for your Loft Conversion in Barnet?</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our creative and innovative ideas in making the space beautiful even if it&rsquo;s limited have been always appreciated by our clients.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While taking up projects, we always try to make the space so that it gives a high return on investment.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strive to build lofts without disturbing the clients in minimum time and in minimum budget.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By using the latest technology and fast means of construction we ensure to meet the potential development requirements.</span></p>\n<p class="Normal1" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; line-height: 16.8667px; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\n	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200528183334loft-conversion-barnet.jpg" style="width: 512px; height: 341px;" /></span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">What makes us Different as a Barnet Loft Conversion Company?&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">1.

Could your house be the following one to join the pattern? How about we discover...</span></p>\n<h3>\n	Type of Roof</h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">When pondering about changing over the loft space in your home, the most significant factor to consider is your current loft structure.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">There are two primary sorts -</span></p>\n<h3>\n	Traditional roof -</h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This sort of rooftop is found in houses that were worked before 1965. They are not quite the same as current rooftops as their rafters structure an M shape that compromises of your loft, and ordinarily have an estimation of 2.2 meters at their most noteworthy point.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	Modern trussed roof -</h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">These rooftops are generally found in homes that were fabricated post-1965. These styles are built with the rafters framing a W shape, and are commonly 2.4 meters at their most elevated point.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Trussed rooftops can be harder to change over than customary rooftops. The issue with trussed rooftops is that, on account of their W shape, the casing, by and large, occupies the majority of the space in the loft, which means the whole casing must be supplanted. Be that as it may, this undertaking is in no way, shape, or form unimaginable - it just might be somewhat more costly to experience.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	Do you have enough room?</h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">When you&#39;ve worked out which sort of loft is best for your home, whip out the estimating tape, it&#39;s an ideal opportunity to get serious. So as to see if changing over your loft is a chance, there are two principle perspectives to consider.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	Floor area -</h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Despite the fact that this is only a general rule, your loft&#39;s interior dividers ought to extend across 7.5 meters from front to back, and 5.5 meters from side to side. Be that as it may, as is referenced, this is only the perfect space. Loft conversion London has the best loft conversion architects at your disposal if you want your dream house to become a reality.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	Roof angle <strong>-</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Any edge over 30 degrees would work best. All together for your proposed loft conversion to pass building guidelines, it must gauge 2.2 meters from the floor to the most noteworthy point. This takes into account adequate head tallness, while simultaneously considering that the rooftop must be protected and the floor developed.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Another integral factor will be access to the loft - do you have sufficient space to raise a flight of stairs on your first floor? This is something your planner will have the option to prompt on.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<strong>Planning &amp; regulations</strong></h3>\n<h4>\n	<strong>Planning Permission -</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Under your allowed residential rights, as a property holder, you are permitted to broaden your rooftop space by up to 50 m3, or 40 m3 for terraced houses. In any case, there are sure details, so you should design appropriately, else it will be considered an undertaking that requires planning endorsement.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Its merits include that these allowed improvement rights don&#39;t generally apply for homes in preservation regions - talk with an engineer or planning official to check whether planning permission is required.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">In case you&#39;re considering experiencing a loft conversion, our Resi draftsmen can guarantee that you remain inside your allowed improvement rights, or even secure planning permission.

While selecting a light color scheme, it has the power to make the loft rooms feel larger and lighter, it needs to be balanced to prevent them from becoming too clinical. Try mixing lighter colors with warm woods and occasional soft furniture in a dark background to make the space feel comfortable and welcoming &ndash; this is particularly crucial if your loft conversion is a way of creating a guest or a spare room.</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li value="3">\n		<h4>\n			<strong>Plan The Furniture&#39;s Layout At Design Stage &ndash;</strong></h4>\n	</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You need to find your completed loft conversion layout long before you start working. This means determining where the pieces of furniture, the bathroom and any built-in storage are to be put. If you are building an en-suite, take into account the height of the ceiling in the room and give priority to the pieces &ndash; that is, the shower and the hand basin &ndash; the headroom cannot be compromised.</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li value="4">\n		<h4>\n			<strong>Maximise Daylight In Your Design &ndash;</strong></h4>\n	</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Taking time to think about the size and location of your windows is an important aspect of the loft conversion design. As a general rule, glazing should make up 20% of the roof area if you want to maximize natural light. The location of the windows is often determined by the shape of the roof; for example , a long, shallow room benefits from windows equally spaced along its length, while a small, deeper room benefits from a wide window. Since each room varies in shape and size, consider what kind of window you need. A top-hung option when the window is within the reach of the arm allows for an unspoiled view and more headroom, while a center-pivot window, operated by a rod, or electronically, is best if the window is out of reach.</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li value="5">\n		<h4>\n			<strong>&nbsp;Balance Out Your House with Loft conversion Hayes &ndash;</strong></h4>\n	</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you have all the living space you need downstairs, but you do not have bedrooms and bathrooms, then a loft conversion can be the perfect way to bring home in proportion. Most loft conversions are used for an extra bedroom or two with an en-suite bathroom. Certain common uses include a teenage den, a movie theater or a home office. If your home has wonderful views, you could consider moving some of the living spaces up into the new loft, too, to take advantage of them.</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li value="6">\n		<h4>\n			<strong>Keep Your Loft Room Open Plan &ndash;</strong></h4>\n	</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you&#39;re going to convert a large loft and add a kitchen, consider sticking to an open plan layout to maximize space. We love this loft conversion idea for its modern design, and the chic moody color scheme works a treat &ndash; largely due to the open plan layout that eliminates the risk of a limited feeling in a small space.</span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li value="7">\n		<h4>\n			<strong>Add a Stylish Bathroom &ndash;</strong></h4>\n	</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Awkward dimensions and bulky beams do not have to be a limiting factor in creating a bathroom in the loft. While the showers require a minimum amount of headroom and easy access, a separate bath can be placed under a low ceiling. Simple shapes and a typical color palette fit well with the architecture of the time.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200803150458loft-conversion-bathroom2.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 314px;" /></span></p>\n<ol>\n	<li value="8">\n		<h4>\n			<strong>Create A Home Office In Your Loft conversion Hayes Design &ndash;</strong></h4>\n	</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If the extra bedroom in the loft isn&#39;t what your family wants, but you&#39;re working from home, your home office could be a fine, lost conversion idea for you. In order to increase efficiency, a home office needs plenty of natural light to avoid black-out blinds and heavy materials. Instead, opt for pale blinds in soothing neutral shades that still let the light in, but also reduce the glare when closed, allowing you to work efficiently even when the sun starts to fall &ndash; as essential for dazzling summer days as for shorter days in the winter months.</span></p>\n<h4 align="center">\n	<strong>THE SIX MAIN TYPES OF LOFT CONVERSION HAYES</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Dormer loft conversions</strong>&nbsp;creates additional headspace and floor space and is a structural extension which projects vertically from the plane of a sloping roof.&nbsp;</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Hip-to-gable loft conversions</strong>&nbsp;is an ideal way to maximise your house space that you have within your loft without having to extend your loft outwards.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Mansard loft conversions&nbsp;</strong>are versatile and suitable for most types of property including terraced houses, bungalows, detached and semi-detached houses. create extra volume.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Velux Loft Conversions </strong>is one that uses roof-lights installed into the pitch of a roof to give natural light and ventilation.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200803145342loft-conversion-dormer.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The majority of the houses are suitable for a loft conversion but there are few parameters that the loft conversion architect needs to check before the conversio</span>n.<br />\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>The requirement of suitable height from floor to roof&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">For the loft conversion to pass building regulations it should have a suitable head height. The minimum height between the floor and the roof should be 2.2 meters so that there is enough headroom after the roof and the floor is insulated. After insulation, the ceiling height should be around 1.9 meters to 2 meters. There are ways of increasing the height of the ceiling but there are some rules in the conservation area that may not permit to alter the height of the roof.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>The requirement of suitable roof pitch</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The roof should have a minimum pitch of 30 degrees. Roof pitch less than 30 degrees have less headroom which may not pass the building regulations of the UK. The more the roof pitch, the more will be the central height of the roof.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>Floor Space</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">This is just a basic guideline. The inner wall dimension should expand across 7.5 meters from front to back and 5.5 meters from one side to another. However, there is no strictness to follow this parameter, and loft conversion can be done even with a lesser dimension.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>Space for access and stairway</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Staircases are a vital part of the loft conversion. It is important to check that there is enough roof pitch and height so that the staircase can be effectively constructed and there is enough headroom. It is also important for passing the building regulations. There should be a minimum of 1.9-meter headroom for the stairs and the pitch of the stairs cannot exceed 42 degrees. But there is no minimum width measurement for the stairs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200528185434velux-loft-conversion-barnet.jpg" style="width: 512px; height: 276px;" /></span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>Roof Structure&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The traditional roofs which had frames are more suited to loft conversion than modern trussed roofs. Loft conversion in traditional framed roofs is much cheaper compared to the trussed roofs and relatively easy. Trussed roofs required the insertion of structural inputs. Steel rods need to be inserted to support the floor and the walls.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>Water Tank and Chimney Stacks&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Water Tanks and Chimney Stacks are not a problem in a loft conversion. Water tanks can be moved to increase the usable space. Chimney Stacks can also be relocated.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>Planning permissions and building regulations</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Building regulations have some basic guidelines that need to be followed before loft conversion. The guidelines vary from area to area in London. So it needs to be properly checked before the loft conversion. In most cases, the planning permissions required are pretty minimal but the norms need to be strictly followed. But sometimes loft conversions do not require permissions. So it is best to consult a loft conversion architect or a planning officer before performing a loft conversion so that the plan stays within the permitted development rights.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>Party wall agreement</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If the house where the loft conversion will be done is a terraced or semi-detached one, a party wall agreement needs to be signed before the construction. It is a legal agreement between you and your neighbor where you need to get consent from your neighbor before building work is done that might affect a shared wall, outbuilding, or a boundary. It is advised to inform the party early and get prior consent from them to avoid any kind of dispute.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<strong>Other problems to loft conversion</strong></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Living in a conservation area or a listed area does not allow alterations in the building. However, a design solution can be easily found which can easily pass the conservation rules.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Let Loft Conversion London help you meet all the criteria and ensure the rules and regulations of loft conversion are easily done and taken care of.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong style="font-size: 22px;">Why loft conversion London as your building partner?</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Hayes is a prominent place situated in the west of London.

Though all home revamping options bring a unique quirk to the home, an attic conversion comes with some most rewarding advantages.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Reason to go for conversion are -</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Increase living space - It&#39;s important to outgrow a home, not only when a new family member arrives, but also needs to extend when youngs reach their teenage. The primary reason to move to another property is the lack of sufficient space to meet their overgrowing needs. Loft conversion adds additional living space to a home, without any hassle. It is a straightforward task to use that dead space for advantage without compromising a property land.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Room with a view -&nbsp; In the busy city or town you can only view housing estates, offices and roads, which is slightly unappealing. For those who are considering conversion, loft conversion comes at such a pleasant surprise. Utilising the high windows, loft conversion allows you to see the whole area from a new perspective with a spectacular view!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Add value -&nbsp; Loft conversion is just not rewarding with extra features; it also adds some real value in your property if in future you ever decide to sell up. A conversion almost adds 20% additional value in your property which makes it a remarkable investment.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Planning permission rarely required -&nbsp; Where in most of the cases, house extension requires planning permission. On the other hand, loft conversion does not need any planning permission as they are already classed as permitted developments unless you are not changing the complete appearance of your house. However, every loft conversion needs to comply with the Building Regulations to achieve adequate standards of building work.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The Building Regulations are concerned with -</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Structural Stability</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Fire Safety</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Fire Resistance</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Resistance to Moisture</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Ventilation</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Noise insulation</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Stairways</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Thermal Insulation</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">TYPES OF LOFT CONVERSION -</span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Where each conversion depends on your requirement, a necessary loft conversion includes the transformation of stairs, chipboard floor and window.

A number of house owners choose to move up rather than moving on and extend their current house to give them an additionally required space.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A loft conversion is an obvious answer if you want to add space and value to your house without having any moving hassle and stress.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">However, make sure that you are equipped with all the necessary facts before opting for the loft conversion.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Here we are sharing a few essential facts, which you should consider before transforming your loft.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Architectural Integrity - Most of the people consider loft conversion as just an extra addition on their house and often neglect the structural integrity of their house. Though it&#39;s necessary to understand that even a little conversion increases weight on your home, hence its important to ensure that your house can bear the added weight. There are several ways you can examine the foundation of your house, but the most common way is to expose the foundations to check the depth and strength along with beams, lintels and pillars. A building control officer may also come to take a look, so make a dig on the edge of the house, so that they can determine if your building needs extra support.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Design - With help with a professional remodelling company, you can also design your new space. A well-designed remodelling gives you control over the changes. Though you can opt for any most suitable designs, three basic conversions designs are:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Dormer -&nbsp; It is a most loved conversion type, that adds more space.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Skylight -&nbsp; This one is the most convenient and affordable conversion type, which does not need any alteration on the roof.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Mansard -&nbsp; Though it is one of the costliest types of conversion, it increases the maximum value and space of the house and gives an aesthetically pleasing.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">A quick recap of the main advantages of conversion -&nbsp; It is worth before finalizing any design, and reminds yourself of the main reason for conversion. Spending money into creating an additional bedroom or space, perhaps with ensuite amenities, and makes a good financial investment sense. Additionally, it&#39;s not just all about living space; it allows you to recognize the space to make the most of every square inch. It helps you not only to come up with a new room but also gives clever storage solutions too. Adding a bedroom or bathroom will surely make your look more attractive to future buyers, but ensure that you are well aware of the hidden charges in terms of expense and the space you will lose from a bedroom.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Planning permission and Building Regulations - As loft conversion is considered to be a minor home improvement project, you may don&#39;t really require to apply for any approval from building regulations. As long as you meet with specific planning criteria, planning permission is not required. However, applying for it does not harm you. However, it is advisable to have your project approved before engaging for the conversion to avoid any future conflicts. Although in most of the cases, meanwhile, you are not doing any major changes, you do not need any approval and can proceed with the project without needing to do so. It is highly recommended that you address any experienced loft conversion company who can guide any support you in proceeding paperwork and in successful project completion. Although if your plans include a dormer conversion or you live in a conservation area, the planning rules can be different lights and ventilation: The beauty of loft conversion is, you don&#39;t necessarily require to do any major alteration on your existing place for natural lights. A skylight loft conversion is a great way that will provide all the natural light you need. Also, it helps your house to stay warm during cold weather, and you can install skylights that can be opened, which does not let your room get stuffy during summers. If you are planning to have windows, dormer loft conversion would be the best choice. However, you may need planning permission for this if you are planning to have a window in front of your house.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Don&#39;t forget about the interior design -&nbsp; Even before starting the work, you need to be clear with your plans and about what you want the end result to look like. Spend some time visualizing what should go where. Including the doors, windows and room layout, consider the location of storage, bathroom facilities and placing of furniture. To ease the overall project, it would be a great option to approach any professional designer or architect to draw a detailed plan. These plans can be twitched and improved until you&#39;re perfectly happy.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Stairs -&nbsp; Stairs can be the trickier aspects of a loft conversion. Because lofts are usually narrow and tight, which create difficulties to get stairs that can reach, narrow stairs can get fit in the small loft space. Off-the-shelf stairs design can be another option for the low loft space. However, you must include your preferred staircase in your conversion plans from the beginning.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Remember to inform your insurer and&nbsp; mortgage lender before going ahead with a loft conversion, as it may result in a higher buildings insurance premium.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&nbsp;A loft conversion is an investment rather than an expense, and a professional loft conversion company can help to apply for planning permission on your behalf whenever necessary and convert your loft as you desired.

Finding the right conversion idea can be challenging as sometimes lofts can be small and somewhat awkward spaces. However, Loft Conversion Gerrards Cross can help you to get the right design to achieve a space that is both functional and valuable.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Take a look at some of the smart and professional ideas to brighten your space.</span></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Twitch functionality - Sloping roof bathrooms can create an awkward situation and can feel the lack of functionality. A small design change can make it a huge difference in the enjoyment and a utilization of using the space. You can make the shower comfortable to use, as you can turn it into a light-filled bathing space with a freestanding tub.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Keep the colours bright - While doing an interior loft conversion, you should accomplish it with bright, light and neutral colours. These colours make it look larger and open up space primarily. As a smaller space in the top of the house may not have many visitors, so you can worry less about keeping these neutral decorations and furnishings clean and clutter-free.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Mezzanine/attic space - Opening up the sloping ceiling to increase the height always leaves a dramatic effect, that makes more natural light and ventilation. The better light makes the room feel bigger and more inviting. You can opt for Dormer or skylight loft conversion here. Though the renovation depends on the height of your ceiling as if you have a tall room, it makes the conversion simpler. On the other hand, if you want to remove the roof to get the desired height, it may be more expensive and a more significant project. Although if you are doing any significant renovation, there are Building Regulations with which you&#39;ll need to comply.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Consider the room purpose - You can transform your loft into a bedroom, bathroom, office and more. Though before putting your hands on it, consider the purpose of the loft conversion carefully. Loft conversion Gerrards Cross can help you to increase the value of your interior loft by suggesting a few valuable ideas by considering the size and architectural features of your attic. That will help you to dictate what type of conversion would work best for you.</span></li>\n	<li>\n		<span style="font-size:22px;">Maximize your storage space - Expanding your loft gives you additional valuable space. Though it completely depends on you how you can maximize the utilization of every bit of that space. However, you can invest in custom made storage and incorporate it with drawers or wardrobes. It helps you to maximize your space and give an elegant look. Floating shelves can be another option for maximizing your space utilization, and it also takes less space and acts as a sleek display unit.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">What to consider with a Loft Conversion for your Gerrards Cross Home</span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;Cost &amp; Feasibility -&nbsp; The cost of a loft conversion depends on several factors, such as the layout, shape, conversion type and age of your house. Having a sufficient headspace has a huge impact on the overall cost and scope of conversion.

As a specialist, Loft conversion Gerrards Cross will be able to advise you with better potential designs.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;Fire Safety -&nbsp; It is always a priority to consider safety implications if you are changing your house structure. If you are adding a new storey, it will need new binding on the ceilings below, to provide extra fire protection and will need a big window as an emergency fire exit.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">&#9679;Building Regulations -&nbsp; As loft conversion is considered as a minor change in the house, and if you are doing an interior loft conversion, you don&#39;t really need to apply for any building regulation approval, but it also does not hurt to apply. It would be a great idea to have permissions before engaging with the services to avoid any further disputes and having it will take the risk out of the project, and make it easier for any builders to give you a fixed quote.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">It can be hard to justify the significant financial investment and the upheaval involved while the works are taking place, if you are not getting proper advantages of conversion for a long term.

If you are craving for extra space or have it already but not sure how to use it, our inspiring loft conversion ideas can help you to turn that place into a beautiful space that you always desire. A well-designed loft room not only creates extra habitable space that helps to free up a busy household, but it also builds the opportunity for a fashionable and unique space.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Before starting working on a loft conversion Isleworth, it&#39;s vital to keep all the ideas in one place. A loft conversion is not just a structure; it is your room configuration, budget, positioning of your doors, windows and furniture and of course your energy efficiency that must be considered.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Find out the best loft conversion ideas that will have your creative juices flowing and loving your new space.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>CREATE AN EXTRA BEDROOM -</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you have a spare room in your loft, you can use it by creating an extra bedroom for your guests. This extra room can add much-needed living space to your existing floor plan.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">However, before starting to work on conversion, you should consider a few things such as space utilization and determine whether or not you need to add insulation, drywall etc. Choosing a light or neutral colour palette for painting the walls can enhance the room&#39;s beauty and make the room look larger. Opting for furniture with storage options built-in can also improve the functionality of your loft. Go for a roof window for nice natural light.</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>KIDS ROOMS ARE PERFECT IN THE LOFT -</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Not having enough head height in the loft is the most challenging thing which we often face. At least 2.2 metres at the highest point has been considered as an ideal height for a comfortable living room. So if you are struggling with the height, you can turn that space into a kids room. This area could be their playroom where they can keep their toys and keep the rest of the house clutter-free. Extra beds could be built into the walls leaving the floor space open so they can spend some good time with their friends here.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>EXTRA BATHROOM -</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Having an extra bathroom is excellent for convenience. If you have enough room, it would be a great option to add some luxury in your bathroom facilities. Adding an extra bathroom also increases the value of your house by as much as 10.5 per cent.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Place a freestanding bath under the slope as loft spaces often have low ceilings or if you are connecting it to a master bedroom, it would be beneficial to keep an open floor plan. A shower will be a great idea if you have enough height. Make it simple with some clean lines, traditional colour palette or with wood furnishing which can make your new loft space feel all the more open and authentic.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>A HOME LIBRARY -</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you have a book lever, adding a space for your books would be a great addition. You can create a finished wall of bookshelves or can utilize your old shelves between the roof beams to create a rustic look. Add some cosy seating area to complete a nice little reading look where you can spend some of your quality time.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>CREATE A MULTIPURPOSE ROOM -</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A loft conversion is a great way to utilize your wasted space to turn into a useful place. In Isleworth, it can add around 11% more value to your place, and if you have frequent guests staying, it can make your life easier. So, even if you do not have any planning to use it for days; it can still be a significant investment.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>A PLACE TO FULFILL YOUR HOBBIES -</strong></span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Most of us miss our hobbies due not to have sufficient space. However, a loft can add that perfect place for you. You can create a game room or home cinema or a music room. Create a soundproof room if you are planning for some activities which might be too noisy to keep next door happy. Add acoustic mineral woods between the floor joints, and thermal insulation to the walls to muffle the sound.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>A HOME OFFICE -</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Now when most people are opting for work from home, converting your empty loft space into something productive can be a great idea. Depending on the space you have, you can create a built-in desk and utilize the natural light and air from the roof window. Also, if you have children, it would be an excellent option for a quiet workspace. Plus if you can look outdoors, if you need any metal break.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>ADD SOME LIGHT AND DRAMA -</strong></span></h3>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">You have enough budget, you can add some WOW factors and architectural glazing. Instead of using chandeliers or pendant lights, opt for small colourful LED lights. As chandeliers or pendant lights take too much space and could limit the movement inside. Use beam light as it will take care of enhancing the pleasant structure of the ceiling. Illuminate the space with beautiful side lamps and wall lightings.</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Working with Loft conversion Isleworth is very convenient and gives excellent value for money.

Because of this mindset, the shortage of living space has become one of the main reasons that push homeowners to consider moving. However, increasing a living space can save plenty of time and money while meeting with their overgrowing needs. Loft conversion delivers the benefit of additional living space to a home.

Most of the people use their loft conversion to make an extra bedroom, though it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it&rsquo;s the only option you can opt for. If you have kids, you can turn your loft into a kids playroom filled with toys, gaming consoles and beautiful little chairs.

A conversion work can be scheduled for any time as it does not rely on factors such as weather. Plus it does not need much labour as the external walls and roofing are already there. It only requires some fundamental changes to support brickwork and floors along with the few additions on the roof wall. Also, to make any other alterations at your home, you may need planning permission. On the other hand, unless you are not doing any major changes, in loft conversion you do not need any planning permission as you are building inside your home and it&#39;s already classed as permitted developments. It excludes the hassle and saves lots of time and fee.</span></p>\n<h4>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Get a Room With A View -</span></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">People who stay in a busy town have often only enjoyed the view of housing estates, roads and offices, which is, of course, no one likes and are quite unappealing. This is also a major reason that renovation becomes a pleasant surprise for people. Most of the loft conversion has big windows that make stargazing on clear evenings appealing. It also allows you to see your local place from a new prospect.</span></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><img alt="" src="	https://loftconversionlondon.com/upload/20200528183334loft-conversion-barnet.jpg" style="width: 512px; height: 341px;" /></span></p>\n<h4>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Schedule Your Loft Conversion Today!</span></h4>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">While loft conversion is a great way to add extra value into your home,&nbsp; it adds extra room, introduces more natural light, provides great views and saves you money in the long run.

You should check that the changes you are considering are able to fulfil your requirements or not. Does it go to give you a profitable return? As a loft storage conversion may not alone significantly increase the Value of your property.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Although your existing loft is not high enough for conversion, you can still alter the section of the roof to get the extra headspace.</span></p>\n<h1>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">How does a loft conversion add Value to a house?</span></h1>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A loft conversion is one of the simplest ways to add Value into your house.

Known as the heart of London; the city is very well planned and properly connected with other major cities. The city is also famous for being the centre of the commercial and tourist hub of <em>Central London.</em></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em>Central London is one of the most </em>desirable areas for families to live because of the abundant green spaces and low crime rates.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<strong>So, why go for a loft conversion in Central London?</strong></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Central London authorities provide several numbers of facilities to the people who live here. Additionally, with the increasing popularity and demand for houses in this area, a loft conversion can increase the value of your house. And you can also rent your house if you don&#39;t want to use that spare area.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Converting your attic into the functional area ultimately results in addition to the value of the property. It also saves you from paying a huge amount of money as converting your loft and reshaping it into a bigger and better form is the best way to go about it.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Plus it gives you opportunities to plan your house according to what you want it to be.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">If you have a grown-up family or teenagers, surely you are looking for a bigger home right!!! So, consider loft conversion, as it not only helps you in getting the desired space but saves you from the hassle of moving.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Confused which type of conversion you should opt for? Well! Here we are sharing a list of conversions types to choose from</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Hip-to-Gable Loft conversion - Hip-to-gable is a perfect option for semi-detached and detached houses. A terraced house generally does not have the required hip, and the roof slope needs to be turned into a vertical line. This conversion is best suitable for chalets and bungalows. If you are looking for a reasonably sizable loft space as standard, we recommend you to go for hip-to-gable conversion. As a major benefit, it often falls under permitted planning permission, so you may not need to take any approval from planning permission. However, typically we seek a Certificate of Lawful Development from the council to avoid any future disputes. It&#39;s also significantly more aesthetically pleasing, which means if you are looking for any exterior of your house to give your home a seamless and natural look regardless of its era, a hip-to-gable loft conversion may be the way to go</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Dormer Loft conversion - A dormer loft conversion means building a box-like structure upon the roof that extends out from the slope of the roof. It can vary according to your budget and the size of the attic. L-shaped Dormer conversion can extend across the body of a house, and designed explicitly for Victorian type homes which have a rear extension with a kitchen and bathroom. Plus it also provides you with an extra floor. A dormer loft conversion is more popular among others, as it is very simple and to build and takes less time than others. Significantly, they also add plenty of space. Plus the vertical walls that you can use with a variety of windows that you&#39;d like, using different materials too. It helps in maximizing sunlight. It is also loved because it is suitable for nearly any home with any shape and size of the roof.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Mansard loft conversion - &nbsp;A mansard loft conversion requires using a traditional sloped roof and then extending one side of the roof to make it vertical at the walls and horizontal on top. However, it required a lot of work and changed the structural integrity of the roof entirely; the end result would be mind blowing. It drastically increases space that is almost the equivalent of adding a full extra floor to the house due to the near verticality of the walls. Can easily perform it on detached, semi-detached, and terraced houses. A mansard loft conversion almost always requires planning permission though it affects both roof shape and structure and thus doesn&#39;t fall into the realms of permitted development as some other types of a loft conversion.</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">Rooflight loft conversions - Also know a Velux loft conversion, convert the current roof space into a loft. Among other types of loft conversion that involve directly changing the structure of a roof, a roof light loft conversion seeks instead to utilize what is already there. This is also one the cheapest types of conversion and does not make any major changes in existing space as they don&#39;t need to alter the roof itself structurally. It also gets completed faster than other methods of the loft conversion.</span></p>\n<h3>\n	<strong>The process of loft conversion</strong><strong> -</strong></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">We plan everything beforehand, and we initiate construction only after our client&#39;s consent.

(45, 'Is your Loft in London Suitable for Conversion ?

Most of the houses within London come with <a href="https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200187/your_responsibilities/37/planning_permission/2">permitted development</a>, which in simpler terms means that you can carry on with your loft conversion without the need of any planning permission. We can visit your house for a site survey and guide you on what can be done with regards to your loft conversion.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Measure the Headspace</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;">Did you know that your Loft needs to have a minimum head height of 2.3m for you to convert it? Yes, that&#39;s correct, there is a limitation on the conversion of your loft based on the height. There are other obstacles which can affect this decision or hinder the planning permission process too, such as the pitch of the roof, chimneys, water tanks in the loft, etc. Don&#39;t worry if your roof space is less then 2.3m as there are various options available such as removal of the section of the roof or all of it, in order to increase the headspace. This, in turn, will add to the cost and will require planning permission, unlike a more straightforward conversion. </span></p>\n<p>\n	<strong><span style="font-size: 22px;">Do consider the floor below</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;">Another idea is to lower the ceiling of the rooms below so that this way your loft&#39;s headspace increases and meets the required 2.3m height. This process again can be costly but can sort your issue for more space.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Look for other Conversions on your Street</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;">An easy way to get a clue if your loft can be converted is to look for loft conversions on your street. Look for similar houses on your street and whether or not they have had loft conversions. If you see example, then its more then likely that you can too.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 22px;">All in all, everything is possible if you want a loft conversion.&nbsp;</span></p>\n', 'feature_74689.png', 0, 1, '2019-06-07'),

Did you know the colors have the power to make a room look and feel bigger? We suggest opting for a light colored scheme, ideally white which will make your loft room much lighter and larger. Decorate the room with soft furnishing of a darker shade which will ensure the room gets a cozy&nbsp;feel to it. It all depends upon, what you intend to use the spare loft room for.

Another factor to consider during the early stages is the location of the stairs. Go through all the possibilities so that you can get the maximum space for your loft conversion.

(48, 'How to increase daylight in your Loft Conversion?', '<h3>\n	Skylights/Rooflights</h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The ideal method is to use <a href="https://www.sunsquare.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-roof-lights-or-skylights/">skylights/rooflights</a> that follow the pitch line of the roof. This is fitted by removing the tiles and battens where the skylight will be fitted. The skylight frame is fitted and the surrounding tiled to a good finish. Such type of window is the most cost-effective and no permission is required to install it.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 22px;">You need to take time out to have a think about how you want your windows in your Loft conversion. Think about the size and where do you want to position them as this is an important factor that can determine how much light you get into your loft. The general rule states that window glazing should make up at least&nbsp;20% of the loft area, that is if you are very keen on natural light. </span></p>\n<h3>\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;">Dormer Windows</span></h3>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;"><a href="https://www.homebuilding.co.uk/dormer-windows/">Dormer windows</a> add the much needed space to your loft conversion, in addition to giving natural light. Dormer windows are most effective when the pitch angle is high, as this way the internal floor area can be increased. The mansard conversion type will give the most converted roof space because it projects the maximum available head space, this providing a bigger usable internal floor area. The hip to gable conversion will also have a similar effect.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2>\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;">Do you know that the position of the windows will help us decide what sort of roof shape to go for?</span></h2>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size: 22px;">For instance, a long, shallow room will benefit from windows that are equally spaced along its length, whereas a narrow deeper room can benefit from just one big window. As all rooms vary in size and shape, you have to take time to consider what type of window will be most apt for your loft conversion. Grant Sneddon, who is a daylight window expert at Velux says &quot; A top-hung alternative whereas the window is just within an arm&#39;s reach gives a better view and more headspace too. He further adds that the center-pivot window, that is operated by a rod or electronically is best if the window is out of reach. All in all, before you start bringing your loft to life, take time about to decide about what window you want and where do you want to place it.&nbsp;</span></p>\n', 'feature_70373.jpg', 0, 1, '2019-05-02'),

', '<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;"><em><strong>Why do people opt for a Loft conversion?</strong></em> This is because properties in London are small and the majority of the time, they lack the extra bedroom or bathroom that is very much required for a growing family. A loft conversion is an ideal way to balance out your house in terms of proportion. As stated most loft conversions are for adding that extra bedroom or two, however, there are other ideas for a loft conversion, such as cinema room, an office, a playroom for the kids and much more. If your house has brilliant views then you must take advantage of this by adding a brilliant loft room. Many people think that the awkward ceilings, beams are a limiting factor when it comes to creating a bathroom in the loft. It is all possible and we have created beautiful bathrooms in the loft with easy access from the loft bedroom. Another alternative to the bathroom is a stylish shower or wet room, but first, you need to check whether you have the permitted headroom for the shower.

By adding a loft conversion will give you the best chance to make your house more energy efficient, as the installation of the insulation is a standard requirement. As per the building regulations, it is required, and there are two forms of insulation which either your local authority or a local building inspector will determine when they visit your house.&nbsp; The<strong> <a href="https://www.jjroofingsupplies.co.uk/blog/warm-roof-vs-cold-roof-whats-the-difference/">Cold Roof Insulation</a></strong>: which in total is 10cm of insulation, 7cm is made up by filling the spaces between the rafters with foam insulation. The remainder of the 3cm of slab&nbsp;insulation is attached to the inside of the rafters. It is important that the 5cm gap is left between the roof felt and insulation in order to allow for ventilation purposes. The Cold Roof insulation is the most straight-forward method to use. Secondly, the <a href="https://www.jjroofingsupplies.co.uk/blog/warm-roof-vs-cold-roof-whats-the-difference/"><strong>Warm-roof insulation</strong></a>, this involves&nbsp;foam insulation of 10cm thick to be fitted&nbsp;over the rafters before the capping, tile battens and tiles are added. When creating a dormer, this is the more difficult option that is usually used when the roof covering has been taken off.&nbsp; This 10cm thick slab of foam insulation can insulate a dormer wall, whereas a 10cm thick quilt of insulation is needed between plasterboard attached to both sides of an internal partition wall. In addition, you will require a 10cm thick insulation between your lofts floor joists. All in all, the insulation work in the loft will help bring the energy costs of your house down.

The new joists will span between the load bearing walls in the loft, and are usually raised slighly above the existing ceiling plasterwork with the use of spaceers below the joist ends. You need to ensure that this spacing must be good enough to avoud any new floor joist deflection from touching the ceiling plaster below. The new joists will run along the existing joists. In addition, above window and door openings, thicker wood is used to bridge the opening, because you do not want pressure on the existing opening lintel. RCJs which are known as Rolled steel joists, are specifically used to distribute the load, and in some installations are used to carry the ends of the new joists. If you head space is limited, then bigger thicker joists, much more closely spaced, can be specified.&nbsp;</span></p>\n', 'feature_97825.jpg', 0, 1, '2019-06-07'),
(56, 'Installation of a New Staircase for a Loft Conversion', '<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">The best place for the staircase to land should be in line with the roof ridge, this is make the best use of the available height above the staircase. The required minimum height above the pitch line is 2m, which can be reduced to 1.9m towards the centre, and further 1.8m to the side of the stairs. In actual sense, the exact staircase position will much depend on the layout of the floor below, and where possibly the available height can be achieved using a dormer or by adding a skylight above the&nbsp; staircase or, if possible, converting a hip rood end to a gable. The maximum number of steps within a straight line are sixteen, a typical installation usually only requires thirteen steps. When it comes to step size, the maximum step rise is 220m and the step depth is around 220mm, both these measurements are taken from the pitch point. The step usually has a nose that protrudes 16-22mm in front of the pitch line. By all means, the ratio size must not exceed the maximum angle of pitch requirement of 42 degrees. Winders should have a minimum requirement of atleast 50mm at the narrowest point. Finally when it comes to <a href="https://www.balustradecomponents.co.uk/blog/a-guide-to-balustrade-height-regulations/">Balustrading</a>, the minimum height is 900mm above the pitch line, and the spindles should have enough seperation distance that a 100mm sphere cannot pass through it.&nbsp;</span></p>\n', 'feature_13360.jpg', 0, 1, '2019-06-07'),
(57, 'Heating and Ventilation in your Loft Conversion in London', '<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">In order to improve your property&#39;s energy efficiency, the roof space should be as airtight as possible. It is <a href="https://www.eco-home-essentials.co.uk/loft-ventilation.html">imperative to introduce controlled ventilation</a> to avoid any risk of condensation and maintain good air quality in your loft. Ventilation in your loft can be via the means of background ventilation such as airbricks and trickle vents, and rapid ventilation via windows, and extract ventilation in wet areas, such as kitchen and bathroom. There is no requirement that the attic bathrooms must have a window given the fact the extract fan can offer rapid ventilation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n	<span style="font-size:22px;">A house extension usually increase the heating requirement of the home, and for this reason your boiler might have to be upgraded, but on the other hand, a loft conversion needs little capacity because the walls will be well insulated which will improve the overall energy efficiency of the property. Heat emitters in the attic rooms can be in the form of radiatiors, underfloor heating or even electic floor heating mats in bathrooms. Please do note that if the bathroom has been added then a boiler upgrade might be needed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n', 'feature_47124.jpg', 0, 1, '2019-06-07'),

Did you know that by adding a loft converion to your property ,you can add more than &pound;42,000 plus to the overall value of your property. An if you add an extra bathroom then the value could further be boosted by &pound;10,000. (Source <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/27/home-extension-or-loft-conversion-can-add-20-to-house-value">TheGaurdian</a>) According to Nationwide Building Society,an extra bathroom might add around 5% or &pound;9600 on to the value of a property in the UK. (Based on average house prices). However by increasing the internal floor space by 10% will add a further &pound;10,000 or 5.1% to the value of the property. Based on average UK property prices, an extension or loft converison could increase your property&#39;s value by over 22% or close to &pound;42,000 and by adding an extra bedroom could boost the value of your property by 11% or &pound;22,100. The chief economist at Nationwide, Robert Gardner, said that home buyers are ready to pay more for extra usable space as this was often seen as a better quality accomodation.
